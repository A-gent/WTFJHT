1/ **Trump Jr. met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya to determine Hillary Clinton's "fitness, character or qualifications" for office**, according to a prepared statement delivered to Senate Judiciary Committee investigators. He maintains that nothing came of the meeting, and he denies explicit collusion with Russia. Trump Jr. took questions behind closed doors.

2/ **Nancy Pelosi urged Trump to reassure DACA recipients they would not be deported within the next six months, **and he acquiesced.** **The message runs counter to previous White House talking points, which [suggest](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/09/05/daca.talking.points%5B8%5D.pdf) DREAMers should "prepare for" imminent departure from the country. Pelosi later [said](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/349634-pelosi-trump-says-that-he-would-sign-the-dream-act-if-it-passed) that if Congress passes the DREAM Act, Trump "would sign it."

3/ **The United States is urging the U.N. Security Council to impose a North Korean oil embargo **and ban exports of the country's textiles. South Korea [expects](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/07/asia/south-korea-thaad-north-korea/index.html) another North Korean ICBM launch on Saturday.

4/ **In a meeting with Congressional leaders, Trump suggested the debt ceiling should be scrapped altogether. **The suggestion came in the same meeting in which Trump struck a fiscal deal with Democrats for a short-term debt ceiling increase, [angering](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/06/hill-trump-relations-242411) Republicans.

5/ **Almost 400 EPA employees have left the agency in recent days, **mostly due to buyouts. When combined with retirements in the same time window, the departures amount to a workforce reduction of about 2.5%.
