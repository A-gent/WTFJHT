1/ **The Senate tax bill would raise taxes on the middle class while giving large cuts to millionaires** over the next decade, according to [analysis](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?id=5040) by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Taxpayers would see their taxes cut by 7.4% on average in 2019, but by 2027 their taxes would rise by an average of 0.2%. Those making between $20,000 and $30,000 would have their tax bills rise 25.4% by 2027 while people earning over $100,000 continue to receive tax cuts.

2/ **House Republicans are set to pass their tax bill with fewer than a dozen of the 240 House Republicans saying they are opposed to the bill**. The House bill delivers more than 80% of its overall cuts to corporations, business owners, and wealthy families subjected to the federal estate tax. A Senate version of the bill contains major differences, including a repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate that would save the government about $300 billion over the next decade. It's unclear whether the final tax bill will resemble anything like what the House is expected to pass.

> **UPDATE:**
>
> **The House passed its rewrite of the tax code**, which would cut taxes by more than $1.4 trillion over 10 years. The bill also cuts the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, collapses the number of tax brackets from seven to four, and eliminates or scales back many popular deductions. The bill passed with 227 votes in favor and 205 against.

3/ **A radio newscaster accused Al Franken of kissing and groping her without consent** during a 2006 U.S.O. tour of the Middle East before he took public office. Franken apologized to Leeann Tweeden, saying he doesn't remember the events of a kiss rehearsal "the same way" as she described. Franken added that a photo of him with his hands over a sleeping Tweeden's breasts "was clearly intended to be funny but wasn’t. I shouldn’t have done it."

* **Mitch McConnell immediately called for an Ethics Committee investigation of Al Franken** after allegations that he groped a woman in 2006. "As with all credible allegations of sexual harassment or assault, I believe the Ethics Committee should review the matter. I hope the Democratic Leader will join me on this," McConnell said. "Regardless of party, harassment and assault are completely unacceptable—in the workplace or anywhere else."

4/ **The Alabama Republican Party is sticking with Roy Moore despite at least nine women accusing Moore of inappropriate, unwanted sexual behavior**. Mitch McConnell has called Moore unfit to serve in the Senate and has [threatened](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/11/15/day-300/#5-mitch-mcconnell-proposed-that-jeff) him with an ethics investigation if he is elected in the December 12th special election. Moore responded to McConnell's threat in a tweet: "Bring. It. On."

5/ **Senate Republicans are exploring the legal feasibility of a second new special election in Alabama** in order to save the Republican seat. The plan would call for Luther Strange – who was appointed to fill Jeff Sessions' vacant seat – to resign, causing a new special election in Alabama. Recent polling has the Democrat Doug Jones leading Moore by at least 12 points in the race. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/15/roy-moore-republicans-alabama-senate-244961))

6/ **The Trump administration lifted the ban on hunters importing elephant trophies** from Zimbabwe and Zambia, reversing a 2014 rule put in place by the Obama White House. Elephants are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.
