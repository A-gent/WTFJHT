1/ **Trump: The Texas church shooting isn't a guns issue, it's a mental health issue**. "Mental health is your problem here," Trump said. "This isn't a guns situation. This is a mental health problem at the highest level." Devin Patrick Kelley, a young white male, was dressed in all-black "tactical-type gear" and wearing a ballistic vest when he opened fire on the church using a Ruger AR-556 semiautomatic rifle. He killed at least 26 people. Kelley passed a background check despite being discharged from the Air Force for "bad conduct" – assaulting his wife and their child. The discharge did not show up as a prohibited offense on his background check.

3/ **The Russian lawyer that met with Trump Jr. claimed he offered to re-examine an anti-Russian law if Trump won the election**. "Looking ahead, if we come to power, we can return to this issue and think what to do about it," Trump Jr. said of the Magnitsky Act, which Natalia Veselnitskaya was lobbying against. Trump Jr. met with the Russian lawyer in June 2016 at Trump Tower after being promised "information that would incriminate" Hillary Clinton.
