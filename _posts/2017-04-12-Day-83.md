1/ **Putin meets with Tillerson in Moscow**. Relations between the US and Russia have grown so tense that it was unclear whether Putin would meet with the Secretary of State. Tillerson's job is to persuade Moscow to abandon its support for Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.

* **Trump and Putin trade barbs as ministers meet**. Trump said Russia was backing "an animal" while Putin said the US had violated the law and that the level of trust with the US had worsened since Trump took office. ([BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39573744){:target="_blank"})

2/ **$1.2 million in payments from a pro-Russian political party have been linked to Paul Manafort's firm in the US**. A handwritten ledger surfaced in Ukraine last August with dollar amounts and dates listed next to the name of Manafort, who was then Donald Trump's campaign chairman. Manafort originally said the transactions in the ledger were fabricated. Now, he says the transactions corroborated are legal. A Ukrainian lawmaker said $750,000 received by Manafort was part of a money-laundering effort. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/20cfc75c82eb4a67b94e624e97207e23){:target="_blank"})

4/ **DeVos rolled back an Obama administration attempt to reform how student loan debt is collected**. Obama issued a pair of memorandums last year requiring that the Federal Student Aid office do more to help borrowers manage their debt. DeVos withdrew the memos, saying the approach was inconsistent and full of shortcomings. She didn’t detail what fell short. More than 1 million Americans are annually defaulting on their student loans.

5/ **The Trump administration is lifting the federal hiring freeze**. The impact is likely to be limited. It will be up to Congress to set spending levels for federal agencies.

6/ **Trump’s budget director says their goal is to maximize high inequality, not low deficits**. Republicans typically frame spending and taxes as a way to reduce out-of-control deficits, while framing regressive tax cuts as being unrelated to deficits. Mulvaney is conceding that deficits have nothing to do with the Republican fiscal agenda.

7/ **Classified documents contradict both Nunes and Trump that Obama ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower to spy on him during the campaign**. Lawmakers have not found evidence that Obama did anything unusual or illegal after reviewing the same intelligence reports brought to light by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes. Nunes prompted outrage after claiming to have learned of possible “incidental collection” of the Trump team’s communications.

10/ **Shifting course, Trump says health care repeal must happen before tax overhaul**. Congressional budget rules will make it easier to pass broad overhauls of the tax code once the $1 trillion in Affordable Care Act taxes have been repealed. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/12/trump-changes-course-again-says-health-care-repeal-must-happen-before-tax-overhaul/){:target="_blank"})

11/ **The Trump administration has suspended its weekly report aimed at putting political pressure on sanctuary cities**. The report was designed to name and shame sanctuary jurisdictions. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/11/politics/trump-sanctuary-city-detainer/index.html){:target="_blank"})
