1/ **Donald Trump Jr. was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton** before meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York on June 9, 2016. A day earlier, Trump Jr. said the meeting was about the issue of US adoptions of Russian children and not the campaign. But in March, Trump Jr. said he never met with any Russians while working in a campaign capacity. The meeting – attended by Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner – was disclosed when Kushner filed a revised form required to obtain a security clearance. Manafort also recently disclosed the meeting and Trump Jr.’s role in organizing it to congressional investigators looking into his foreign contacts.

2/ **Trump Jr. tried to downplay his meeting with Russian lawyer**, tweeting that "Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent."
