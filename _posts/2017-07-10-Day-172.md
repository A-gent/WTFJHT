1/ **Donald Trump Jr. was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton** before meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York on June 9, 2016. A day earlier, Trump Jr. said the meeting was about the issue of US adoptions of Russian children and not the campaign. But in March, Trump Jr. said he never met with any Russians while working in a campaign capacity. The meeting – attended by Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner – was disclosed when Kushner filed a revised form required to obtain a security clearance. Manafort also recently disclosed the meeting and Trump Jr.’s role in organizing it to congressional investigators looking into his foreign contacts.

2/ **Paul Ryan will no longer hold public town halls** because he doesn't "want to have a situation where we just have a screaming fest, a shouting fest, where people are being bused in from out of the district to get on TV because they're yelling at somebody." ([CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-ryan-tries-to-quell-town-hall-controversy-but-residents-still-want-to-talk-to-him/))

3/ **Trump defended Ivanka's seat-holding at the G20**, saying "If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother, as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!" Clinton responded on Twitter: "Good morning Mr. President. It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me." Ivanka sat in for Trump when he stepped away for a one-on-one discussions with other leaders. Ivanka serves as an unpaid adviser to Trump as the assistant to the president with an office in the West Wing, blurring the lines between family and official business.
