1/ **The Supreme Court partly reinstated Trump's travel ban**. The administration may now impose a 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the US, as long as they lack a “credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” Trump said the ban would go into effect 72 hours after receiving an approval from the courts. The court will hear arguments in the case in October. Three justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch — said they would have let the complete ban take effect while the court considers the case.

2/ **Trump will meet with Putin in Germany next month**. Trump wants a full bilateral meeting, while the State Department and National Security Council are urging for restraint. All 17 US intelligence agencies have agreed Russia was behind the hack of DNC's email and tried to influence the election to benefit Trump. A former KGB general said Putin has “other priorities” than discussing the accusations that Russia hacked the election, such as easing sanctions, raising oil prices, as well as next year’s presidential elections in Russia.

3/ **A Russian government official making $75,000 per year spent nearly $8 million on Trump condos** in South Florida. There is also no public disclosure of Igor Zorin's properties in Russia, which is illegal under Russian law. None of Zorin’s property purchases used bank financing, meaning he most likely paid cash. He made roughly $75,000 in 2015 and $159,000 in 2016. In one sale, a Florida company transferred a condo valued at $1.5 million to Zorin. No deed of sale was recorded, meaning the price paid — if any — is unknown. ([Miami Herald](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article157640179.html))

4/ **Russia is recalling Sergey Kislyak** as the FBI and Congress continue to investigate the 66-year-old diplomat’s contacts with Trump’s team during the 2016 presidential campaign. Kislyak spent nearly 10 years at the center of US–Russia relations. ([BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnhudson/moscow-is-finally-recalling-russian-ambassador-sergey))

5/ **The Trump administration has done little to prevent Russian hacking in the next election**. Trump has shown no interest about how to prevent future election interference. Comey testified that Trump never asked him about how to stop a future election attack, while Jeff Sessions, who sits on the National Security Council, testified that he has not received a classified briefing on Russian election interference. Sean Spicer has never addressed the topic with Trump, either. Despite blaming the 2016 hacks on Obama, Trump hasn't said what he would do to stop Russian hacking.

6/ **White House allies are retaliating against a Republican Senator who opposes the Obamacare repeal plan**. America First Policies launched a $1 million attack against Dean Heller to both punish and sway his vote. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/25/trump-heller-health-care-obamacare-239941))

7/ **Kellyanne Conway suggested people who lose Medicaid coverage could find jobs to provide health insurance**. Projections show the Senate health bill would cut Medicaid by $800 billion, which Conway asserted is not a cut, but rather "getting Medicaid back to where it was." ([CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/25/kellyanne-conway-those-on-medicaid-who-will-lose-insurance-can-get-jobs.html) / [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kellyanne-conway-senate-health-bill-cuts-medicaid/story?id=48255191))

8/ **Senate Republicans are skeptical their health care bill can pass this week**. Republicans say the biggest problems with the Obamacare repeal bill are its steep Medicaid cuts and effects on older Americans’ premiums. “There's no way we should be voting on this” before the recess, Senator Ron Johnson said, urging party leaders to “not rush this process.” ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/25/obamacare-repeal-senate-republicans-239937))

9/ **Ivanka Trump, senior adviser to the president: "I try to stay out of politics."** She's met with senators to discuss paid family leave, delivered the keynote at the Republican National Convention, and has met with world leaders. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ivanka-trump-stay-politics/story?id=48280620) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/playbook/2017/06/26/ivanka-sr-adviser-to-potus-i-try-to-stay-out-of-politics-health-care-crunch-week-cbo-expected-to-project-big-coverage-losses-sen-ron-johnson-blasts-bill-in-nyt-221021))

10/ **Trump drives his golf cart on the green.** Doesn't care. Does it all the time. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/06/22/what-the-hell-trump-president-upsets-golf-fans-after-driving-cart-on-green/))
