* **Susan Collins said Trump’s threats to cut off funding for key Obamacare payments won’t change her vote** on the GOP’s plan to repeal it. “It would not affect my vote on healthcare, but it’s an example of why we need to act: to make sure that those payments, which are not an insurance company bailout, but rather help people who are very low-income afford their out-of-pocket costs toward their deductibles and their co-pays,” Collins said. “It really would be detrimental to some of the most vulnerable citizens if those payments were cut off.” ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/344549-collins-trumps-threat-to-end-obamacare-payments-wont-change-my-vote))
