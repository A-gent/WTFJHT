5/ **The Trump administration slammed the CBO estimate that millions of people would become uninsured** under the Republicans' plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The CBO found that 14 million people would lose their insurance coverage by next year under the bill, with the number rising to 24 million over a decade. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said "it's just not believable" and "virtually impossible" for the CBO estimate to occur.

* **Paul Ryan: CBO report on ObamaCare repeal "exceeded my expectations."** Ryan said the CBO's prediction that 14 million more Americans would be uninsured in 2018 was due to the bill's overturning of ObamaCare's individual mandate. *C'mon guy.* ([Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/13/paul-ryan-cbo-report-on-obamacare-repeal-exceeded-my-expectations.html){:target="_blank"})

* **CBO: Defunding Planned Parenthood would lead to thousands more births**. Analysts estimate that excluding the women’s health organization from the Medicaid program for one year would affect low-income areas and communities without many health care options, leaving 15% of those people “without services that help women avert pregnancy.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/13/cbo-defunding-planned-parenthood-would-lead-to-thousands-more-births/){:target="_blank"})
* **Trump’s backing a healthcare plan that breaks his promises**. Trump was clear both as a candidate and as president: No one would be left behind under his health care plan.

7/ **Trump said it could take several years for health insurance prices to start to drop under the healthcare replacement plan** he is promoting, creating a rocky transition period that could pose a risk for members of Congress up for re-election next year and Trump’s own bid for a second term in 2020.

8/ **Breitbart turns up the heat on Paul Ryan, leaking audio of Ryan disavowing Trump.** “I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future,” Ryan says in an October conference call intended for House Republican members.
