1/ **Jeff Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee he didn't lie under oath, but he has "no clear recollection" of the proposed Trump-Putin meeting**. Despite repeatedly answering with "I do not recall" to questions about a March 2016 meeting where George Papadopoulos proposed that Trump meet with Putin, Sessions said he [believes he rejected](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/11/01/day-286/#1-trump-did-not-dismiss-the-idea-of) the suggested meeting. Later during testimony, Sessions was more direct: "At the meeting, I pushed back." In January, Sessions testified that he had no communications with Russians during the 2016 campaign. It was later revealed that he met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak [at least twice](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/06/01/Day-133/#3-congress-is-examining-whether-jeff) during the campaign.

2/ **Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee there was "not enough basis" for assigning a new special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton**. Earlier, Sessions sent a letter sent informing the Committee that the Justice Department was looking into whether a special counsel should be appointed to investigate the Clinton Foundation and a 2010 deal to sell a US uranium company to Russia. On November 3rd, Trump said he was "very unhappy," "disappointed," and "frustrated" with the Justice Department for not investigating Hillary Clinton.

3/ **Trump tweeted about John Podesta's hacked emails 15 minutes after Wikileaks told Trump Jr. "we just released Podesta Emails Part 4."** While Trump Jr. didn't respond to the message, he tweeted out a link Wikileaks had provided him two days later.

* **Mike Pence denied knowing that Trump Jr. was in contact with Wikileaks during the campaign**. In October 2016, Pence was asked if the Trump campaign was "in cahoots" with WikiLeaks as it released droves of damaging information about Hillary Clinton. "Nothing could be further from the truth," Pence replied. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/13/pence-trump-wikileaks-russia-244863))

4/ **The US embassy in Moscow hired a security firm owned by Putin's former KGB counter-intelligence director** to provide "local guard services" for the US mission in Russia. Moscow forced Washington to cut its diplomatic staff in Russia from more than 1,200 to 455 in [response](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/28/day-190/#4-russia-retaliated-against-congress) to sanctions adopted against Russia in August. To make up for the loss of security guards, Washington awarded Elite Security a $2.8 million no-bid contract, which was founded founded in 1997 by Viktor Budanov and his son Dmitry. Budanov retired from espionage in 1992.
