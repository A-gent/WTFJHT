## _News of Lesser Importance_

1/ **Paul Ryan: Trump asking for Comey's loyalty is "obviously" inappropriate** and it's clear that Russia meddled in the US election. "What we need to determine is not whether they did it -- we know that. It's what did they do, how did they do it, how do we prevent it from happening again? And then how do we help our allies so that this doesn't happen to them?" ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/paul-ryan-james-comey-testimony-russia/index.html))

2/ **Who were the senators asking Comey questions today?** There are 15 full-time members of the committee — eight Republicans and seven Democrats — and the panel is considered to be one of the last bastions of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/06/08/a-viewers-guide-to-the-james-b-comey-hearing-who-are-the-senators-asking-him-questions/))

3/ **Republican National Committee will lead Trump's response to Comey's testimony**. A team of about 60 RNC staffers will mount a political offensive aimed at Democrats in response to Comey's testimony. The RNC has lined up a host of surrogates to appear on national and local television and radio to support Trump. The rapid response team will leverage their database of opposition research to use Democrats past statements against them. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rnc-to-lead-trumps-offensive-against-comey-1496877520))

4/ **Trump's FBI pick has Russian ties**. Christopher Wray's law firm – King & Spalding – represents Rosneft and Gazprom, two of Russia’s biggest state-controlled oil companies. ([USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/06/08/trump-new-fbi-director-chris-wray-russian-ties-rosneft-gazprom-column/102603214/))

5/ **The House of Representatives votes on a bill today that would gut major elements of Dodd-Frank**, the regulatory legislation drafted in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The Financial Choice Act would exempt financial institutions deemed "too big to fail" from Dodd-Frank’s restrictions that limit risk taking. Republicans say Dodd-Frank regulations are the primary reason for anemic economic growth in the US. The bill is expected to pass the House with only Republican support, but faces long odds of becoming law as it would require the support of Democrats in the Senate in order to reach Trump’s desk. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/business/dealbook/house-financial-regulations-dodd-frank.html) / [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/08/news/economy/house-dodd-frank-repeal/index.html))
