4/ **Comey blasts the White House for "lies, plain and simple."** The fired FBI director accused Trump and his aides of defaming him after his ouster. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239294))

5/ **James Comey: The administration is working to "defame" me and the FBI, and telling "lies" to the American people.** Although the law requires no reason at all to fire an FBI director the administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI by saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the work force had lost confidence in its leader,” Comey said. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/james-comey-testifies-trump-administration-lied-defamed-fbi/story?id=47901315))

7/ **How cable news networks are reacting to Comey’s hearing**. Coverage of former FBI director James Comey’s testimony looks about the same across cable news channels.

## _News of Lesser Importance_

1/ **Paul Ryan: Trump asking for Comey's loyalty is "obviously" inappropriate** and it's clear that Russia meddled in the US election. "What we need to determine is not whether they did it -- we know that. It's what did they do, how did they do it, how do we prevent it from happening again? And then how do we help our allies so that this doesn't happen to them?" ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/paul-ryan-james-comey-testimony-russia/index.html))

2/ **Who are the senators asking Comey questions today?** There are 15 full-time members of the committee — eight Republicans and seven Democrats — and the panel is considered to be one of the last bastions of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/06/08/a-viewers-guide-to-the-james-b-comey-hearing-who-are-the-senators-asking-him-questions/))

3/ **Republican National Committee will lead Trump's response to Comey's testimony**. A team of about 60 RNC staffers will mount a political offensive aimed at Democrats in response to Comey's testimony. The RNC has lined up a host of surrogates to appear on national and local television and radio to support Trump. The rapid response team will leverage their database of opposition research to use Democrats past statements against them. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rnc-to-lead-trumps-offensive-against-comey-1496877520))

4/ **Trump's FBI pick has Russian ties**. Christopher Wray's law firm – King & Spalding – represents Rosneft and Gazprom, two of Russia’s biggest state-controlled oil companies. ([USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/06/08/trump-new-fbi-director-chris-wray-russian-ties-rosneft-gazprom-column/102603214/))

5/ **The House of Representatives votes on a bill today that would gut major elements of Dodd-Frank**, the regulatory legislation drafted in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The Financial Choice Act would exempt financial institutions deemed "too big to fail" from Dodd-Frank’s restrictions that limit risk taking. Republicans say Dodd-Frank regulations are the primary reason for anemic economic growth in the US. The bill is expected to pass the House with only Republican support, but faces long odds of becoming law as it would require the support of Democrats in the Senate in order to reach Trump’s desk. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/business/dealbook/house-financial-regulations-dodd-frank.html) / [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/08/news/economy/house-dodd-frank-repeal/index.html))

6/ **House and Senate Democrats plan to sue Trump over conflicts of interest** related to the his corporation’s business deals and foreign governments looking to curry favor with the administration. They claim he is breaking the law by refusing to relinquish ownership of his sprawling real-estate empire while it continues to profit from business with foreign governments. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/07/democrats-donald-trump-sue-conflict-of-interest-239262))

7/ **Trump doesn't plan to fire Sessions**, despite his frustration with Sessions for the handling of the administration’s failed travel ban and for recusing himself from the Russia probe. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-06-08/trump-said-to-have-no-plan-to-fire-sessions-as-attorney-general))

* **The White House won't say if Trump has confidence in Jeff Sessions**. For two straight days, Sean Spicer and Sarah Sanders declined to say if Trump has confidence in the attorney general. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/for-second-straight-day-no-wh-vote-of-confidence-for-sessions-2436177029.html))

8/ **Former Watergate special prosecutor: I helped prosecute Watergate. Comey’s statement is sufficient evidence for an obstruction of justice case.** The ball is in Bob Mueller’s court to decide whether he has enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction and, if so, whether to reach the same conclusion that I reached in the Nixon investigation — that, like everyone else in our system, a president is accountable for committing a federal crime.

poll/ **Trump's approval rating hits 34%**, a new Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday finds. 40% of voters do not expect Trump to complete his four-year term. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/donald-trump-approval-rating-quinnipiac/index.html))
