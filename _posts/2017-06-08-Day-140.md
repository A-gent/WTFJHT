([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/james-comey-testifies-trump-administration-lied-defamed-fbi/story?id=47901315))

([HuffPost](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oval-office-recording-system-trump-tapes_us_59397b6be4b00610548089b2))

6/ **Paul Ryan defended Trump's attempt to influence Comey: He's "new at this."** He added that Trump is "new to government. And so he probably wasn’t steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI, and White Houses. ([HuffPost](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-comey-testimony_us_593970e2e4b0c5a35c9d1118))

8/ **Paul Ryan: Trump asking for Comey's loyalty is "obviously" inappropriate** and it's clear that Russia meddled in the US election. "What we need to determine is not whether they did it -- we know that. It's what did they do, how did they do it, how do we prevent it from happening again? And then how do we help our allies so that this doesn't happen to them?" ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/paul-ryan-james-comey-testimony-russia/index.html))

11/ **The House of Representatives votes on a bill today that would gut major elements of Dodd-Frank**, the regulatory legislation drafted in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

Republicans say Dodd-Frank regulations are the primary reason for anemic economic growth in the US. The bill is expected to pass the House with only Republican support, but faces long odds of becoming law as it would require the support of Democrats in the Senate in order to reach Trump’s desk. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/business/dealbook/house-financial-regulations-dodd-frank.html) / [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/08/news/economy/house-dodd-frank-repeal/index.html))

([Axios](https://www.axios.com/for-second-straight-day-no-wh-vote-of-confidence-for-sessions-2436177029.html))

14/ **Former Watergate special prosecutor: I helped prosecute Watergate. Comey’s statement is sufficient evidence for an obstruction of justice case.** The ball is in Bob Mueller’s court to decide whether he has enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction and, if so, whether to reach the same conclusion that I reached in the Nixon investigation — that, like everyone else in our system, a president is accountable for committing a federal crime. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/former-watergate-prosecutor-comey-lays-out-sufficient-evidence-for-an-obstruction-of-justice-case/2017/06/07/a12964a4-4be3-11e7-9669-250d0b15f83b_story.html))
