1/ **Michael Flynn didn't tell the White House about his 2017 interview with the FBI**.

The meeting took place without a lawyer present and without the knowledge of the president or top White House officials.

2/ **Robert Mueller's team has interviewed Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, National Security Agency director Mike Rogers, and CIA director Mike Pompeo**. The three have been described as "peripheral witnesses" to the James Comey firing. Of note: Pompeo "was allegedly asked by Trump to lean on Comey to drop his investigation."

3/ **Trump asked the acting director of the FBI how he voted in the 2016 election** shortly after the president fired James Comey in May 2017. Andrew McCabe said he didn't vote. Trump then "vented his anger at McCabe over the several hundred thousand dollars in donations that his wife, a Democrat, received for her failed 2015 Virginia state Senate bid from a political action committee controlled by a close friend of Hillary Clinton."

4/ **Sarah Sanders: Trump hasn't fired Robert Mueller partly because of how the press would react**. Sanders told reporters that "I think we all know what everybody in this room would do if the President did that, and I don't think that is helpful to the process."

5/ **Former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates added an attorney to his legal team.** The move to hire Tom Green suggests there is an ongoing negotiation between Gates and Robert Mueller's office. Gates pleaded not guilty in October to eight charges of money laundering and failure to register foreign lobbying and businesses.

6/ **Trump will declassify the Devin Nunes memo that alleges FBI surveillance abuse** if the House Intelligence Committee approves the release.
