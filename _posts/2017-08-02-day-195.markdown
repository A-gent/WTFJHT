1/ **Trump signed the bill to impose sanctions on Russia and limit his authority to lift them**. He expressed concerns that the measure included “a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions,” leaving room for interpretation of how the law is enforced.  Trump said he believed the bill to be "seriously flawed," but signed it anyway. The bill also imposes sanctions on Iran and North Korea.

2/ **Trump endorsed a Senate bill aimed at slashing immigration levels** over a decade and shift the system's emphasis away from family ties and toward skills. GOP Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue introduced a modified version of their bill, which would cut immigration by half, tighten rules for temporary workers, restrict family-based visas, and cap the refugee program at 50,000 per year. More than 1 million green cards are currently granted per year. The bill faces long odds, as Republicans will have difficulty getting the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster.

3/ **Rex Tillerson tells North Korea: "We are not your enemy."** He added that the US does "not seek a regime change, we do not seek a collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula, we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th Parallel." Yesterday, [Lindsey Graham said](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/01/day-194/#12-the-military-will-test-launch-an) "there is a military option to destroy North Korea's (missile) program and North Korea itself... (Trump) told me that to my face."

4/ **Tillerson won't spend nearly $80 million allocated for fighting terrorist propaganda and Russian disinformation**, despite pleas from State Department officials. $60 million will expire on September 30th if it's not transferred to the State Department by then. The money is potentially unwelcome because attempts to counter Russian influence would anger Moscow. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/02/tillerson-isis-russia-propaganda-241218))

5/ **Trump: "That White House is a real dump,"** he told members at his Bedminster golf club. He then teed off. ([Golf](http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/08/01/president-donald-trump-relationship-golf-more-complicated-now))
