1/ **Trump and Trump Jr. received an email with the decryption key needed to open the hacked DNC documents** that WikiLeak had posted two months earlier. The September 4th email came the same day that Trump Jr. first tweeted about WikiLeaks and Hillary Clinton, and one month before WikiLeaks began leaking the contents of John Podesta's hacked emails. WikiLeaks contacted Trump Jr. directly on Twitter about the campaign a few weeks later. Trump Jr. told investigators he had no recollection of the email, which was sent by somebody named Mike Erickson. *\[Editor's note: The Washington Post is reporting that the email was sent on Sept. 14th. Will update when this is confirmed.\]* ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/08/politics/email-effort-give-trump-campaign-wikileaks-documents/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/email-offering-trump-campaign-wikileaks-documents-referred-to-information-already-public/2017/12/08/61dc2356-dc37-11e7-a841-2066faf731ef_story.html))

2/ **Trump offered a second endorsement of Roy Moore**, the Republican Senate candidate accused of sexual assault and misconduct by several women. Trump tweeted that Alabama voters should keep the Senate seat under GOP control and away from Democrat Doug Jones, a "Pelosi/Schumer puppet." Moore has a history of saying controversial things. He's argued that slavery was the last time America was great and that homosexuality should be illegal; he also doesn't believe that Obama was born in the United States, and he blames drive-by shootings on teaching evolution.
