1/ **"I did not collude," Jared Kushner said in prepared remarks ahead of his closed door meeting with the Senate Intelligence Committee today**. Kushner said he was unaware that the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer was about providing the Trump campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Kushner will not be under oath for the Senate meeting. He will speak to the House Intelligence Committee tomorrow.

2/ **Kushner's statement included details of a previously undisclosed meeting with the Russian ambassador** in April 2016. Kushner met Ambassador Sergei Kislyak at an event at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, DC in April 2016 – the same event where Jeff Sessions met with the ambassador, [but didn't remember](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/06/01/Day-133/#3-congress-is-examining-whether-jeff). He blamed the omission on his security clearance forms as a mistake made by his assistant.
