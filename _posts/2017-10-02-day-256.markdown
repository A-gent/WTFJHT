1/ **Trump called the Las Vegas shooting "an act of pure evil,"** which killed at least 58 and injured more than 500 people. Police said the gunman was found dead in his Mandalay Bay Hotel room. Trump praised the “miraculous” speed with which local law enforcement responded to the shooting, ordered flags flown at half-staff, and said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday. Gunmaker stocks, meanwhile, are up nearly 4% after one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history.

2/ **The House could vote on legislation this week that would roll back restrictions on gun silencers**. The silencer measure is part of the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, a bill that was [delayed in June](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/06/14/Day-146/#8-tomorrows-congressional-hearing-to) after House GOP Whip Steve Scalise and two Capitol Hill police officers were shot during a congressional baseball practice. The House is also expected to vote on separate legislation, the Hearing Protection Act, this fall that would allow people to carry their legally concealed weapons across state lines into jurisdictions that restrict weapons concealment.

3/ **Rex Tillerson said the US is in direct communication with North Korea about its nuclear program** even after Trump tweeted in August that “[talking is not the answer](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/30/day-223/)!” and vowed to “[totally destroy](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/09/25/day-249/#6-north-korea-accused-trump-of-decla)” North Korea. “We are probing, so stay tuned,” the Secretary of State said. “We can talk to them, we do talk to them directly, through our own channels,” adding that the US has “a couple, three channels open to Pyongyang.” ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-30/u-s-government-talks-directly-with-north-korea-tillerson-says) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/world/asia/us-north-korea-tillerson.html))

4/ **Trump called Tillerson's effort to communicate with North Korea a waste of time**, undercutting his Secretary of State and seemingly ruling out a diplomatic resolution to the confrontation with Pyongyang. "I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man," Trump tweeted, adding, "Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"

5/ **Trump urged senior staff to portray his as a "crazy guy,"** while discussing whether the US would withdraw from the South Korean trade deal. "That's not how you negotiate," Trump told trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer. "You don't tell them they've got 30 days. You tell them, 'This guy's so crazy he could pull out any minute,'" adding "You tell them if they don't give the concessions now, this crazy guy will pull out of the deal." The White House did not dispute the account. Meanwhile, North Korean officials have been [trying to arrange talks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-seeks-help-from-republican-analysts-whats-up-with-trump/2017/09/26/ea91909e-a278-11e7-8c37-e1d99ad6aa22_story.html) with Republican analysts in Washington in an attempt to make sense of Trump and his confusing messages to Kim Jong Un’s regime.
