1/ **Trump said he’ll "be talking about gun laws as time goes by,"** echoing what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said yesterday that “there will certainly be a time for that policy discussion to take place, but that’s not the place that we’re in at this moment.” Steve Bannon warned that it "will be the end of everything" if Trump supports gun control legislation, and Roger Stone added that the "base would go insane and he knows it."

Jimmy Kimmel, who is from Las Vegas, called on President Trump and members of Congress to act in the wake of the shooting.

2/ **Robert Mueller's top legal counsel is researching limits on pre-emptive presidential pardons**. Michael Dreeben has been researching past pardons and determining if any limits exist as current and former Trump advisers are under the special counsel's scrutiny. Trump has [tweeted](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/22/day-184/#1-trump-lost-his-shit-on-twitter-tod) that "all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon." Pardons of a president’s campaign workers, family members, and himself are largely uncharted legal territory. Mueller has a [team of 16 seasoned prosecutors](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/special-counsel-robert-mueller-assembled-team-16-seasoned/story?id=50186443) investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and any potential collusion between Russian  and members of Trump’s campaign.

3/ **The Justice Department overruled memos that concluded presidents cannot appoint their relatives to the White House staff or presidential commissions**, a Freedom of Information Act request revealed. The request to rule the earlier opinions [erroneous or obsolete](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/justice-department-blesses-white-house-post-for-kushner-233968) came from the incoming Trump administration in January, which cleared the way for Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump to take roles in the White House. Appointments of family members have been illegal under an anti-nepotism law passed in 1967.

4/ **Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump used a third private email address for government business**. Hundreds of emails were sent from the couple's White House email addresses to accounts on Kushner's private domain that they shared with their personal staff. The emails contained nonpublic travel documents, internal White House schedules, and other official White House materials. It was previously reported that Kushner and Ivanka used personal email accounts to conduct some government business.

5/ **The Senate Foreign Relations Committee wants to know if White House officials used private emails for diplomacy**. Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the committee, asked Rex Tillerson and White House Counsel Don McGahn for information about whether Kushner or other officials communicated via private email or text with representatives of foreign governments, political parties, or international organizations.
