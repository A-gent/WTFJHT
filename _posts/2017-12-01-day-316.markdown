1/ **Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with Russian Ambassador** Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition last December. Flynn is the fourth Trump associate to be charged in Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/michael-flynn-guilty-russia-investigation.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michael-flynn-charged-with-making-false-statement-to-the-fbi/2017/12/01/e03a6c48-d6a2-11e7-9461-ba77d604373d_story.html))

2/ **Flynn promised "full cooperation" with Mueller's investigation** and is prepared to testify that Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians. The FBI said Flynn communicated with Sergey Kislyak, the then-Russian Ambassador to the US, after being asked by a senior Trump transition official to find out where foreign governments stood on an upcoming UN Security Council resolution about Israel. The FBI did not name the officials.

3/ **Trump lobbied several Senate Republicans over the summer to "to wrap up" the Russia investigation**. The chairman of the intelligence committee, Richard Burr, said Trump made a request "something along the lines of 'I hope you can conclude this as quickly as possible.'" Trump also approached Senator Roy Blunt, who sits on the committee, and Mitch McConnell, with requests to end the investigations. Trump has now asked at least seven officials in both branches of Congress and the Department of Justice to end the multiple investigations. The White House said Trump "at no point has attempted to apply undue influence on committee members."

4/ **Senate Republicans appear to have the votes needed to pass their tax bill**. Holdouts Steve Daines, Ron Johnson, and Jeff Flake all said they will support the bill. "We have the votes" Mitch McConnell told reporters after meeting with his caucus.

5/ **The Treasury's inspector general is investigating whether Steve Mnuchin hid an analysis of the Republican tax bill** — or if it even did one. Mnuchin has said economic growth from the bill’s large tax cuts would offset lost revenue and indicated his department would produce an analysis proving it. No report has been released.

6/ **Trump said a government shutdown could be good for him politically** if Congress doesn't pass a short-term spending bill by the December 8th deadline. Trump wants to blame Democrats and use the shutdown to get money for his border wall.
