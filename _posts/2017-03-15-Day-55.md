1/ **The cost of failure on health care repeal? It may be the rest of Trump’s agenda.** Tax cuts, infrastructure and other White House priorities hinge on scaling back Obamacare. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-cost-of-failure-on-health-care-it-may-be-the-rest-of-trumps-agenda/2017/03/14/f502a846-08be-11e7-93dc-00f9bdd74ed1_story.html){:target="_blank"})

2/ **Nervous GOP Senators call for changes in health care bill** They want to see lower insurance costs for poorer, older Americans and an increase in funding for states with many hard-to-insure people. Conservative House Republicans already believe the bill is too generous. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/us/politics/paul-ryan-health-care.html){:target="_blank"})

3/ **The FBI was investigating former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn as recently as December**. It remains unknown when the FBI first started investigating Flynn and whether the probe has since been closed.

4/ **Kaine expects FBI to announce White House-Russia investigation**. Kaine stressed that the investigation must look into whether the highest office in the land is connected to Russia.

5/ **Lindsey Graham on Trump wiretap claims: "If it's not true, just tell me."** Graham said the FBI needs to stop stonewalling his request to clear up wiretapping claims Trump made against his predecessor and produce evidence that it happened. ([Today](http://www.today.com/news/lindsey-graham-trump-wiretap-claims-if-it-s-not-true-t109239){:target="_blank"})

6/ **Trump will reexamine fuel efficiency standards set in place during the Obama administration**, opening the door for the regulations to potentially be reduced in the coming years. Trump will not take steps to revoke a waiver that allows California and a dozen other states to enforce emissions standards beyond those of the EPA. If those regulations remain intact, automakers will still be compelled to produce more fuel efficient cars regardless of any changes at the federal level. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/03/15/trump-to-pull-back-epas-fuel-efficiency-determination-opening-the-door-for-reduced-standards/){:target="_blank"})

7/ **Spicer is "very confident" that wiretapping evidence will emerge**, bolstering Trump’s unproven accusation about his predecessor. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/us/politics/trump-obama-wiretapping-sean-spicer.html){:target="_blank"})

8/ **China to Trump: We don’t want a trade war — but if there is one, your companies would bear the brunt.**. China’s trade and investment ties with the United States created up to 1 million American jobs last year. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-tells-trump-we-dont-want-a-trade-war-but-us-firms-would-suffer-most/2017/03/15/4e93c3da-0942-11e7-8884-96e6a6713f4b_story.html){:target="_blank"})

poll/ **Only 24% of voters support the GOP health care plan**. The Affordable Care Act, meanwhile, continues to post some of the best numbers it's ever seen, with 47% of voters in favor of it to 39% who are opposed.
