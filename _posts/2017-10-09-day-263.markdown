1/ **The Trump administration will roll back the Clean Power Plan**. Scott Pruitt will sign the new rule tomorrow, which will override Obama's policy to curb greenhouse gas from power plants. "The war on coal is over," Pruitt declared.  ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/94c981eb440f43c3bbbfff84063a9ecc/Trump-administration-to-terminate-Obama's-climate-plan) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/climate/clean-power-plan.html))

2/ **The attorney for the Russian billionaire who pushed for the Trump Tower meeting said an email shows the meeting wasn't about Hillary Clinton**. In the newly disclosed email, Natalia Veselnitskaya asked music publicist Rob Goldstone if she could bring a “lobbyist and trusted associate" because of his knowledge of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law despised that imposed financial sanctions on wealthy Russians as punishment for human rights abuses. The email was disclosed by Scott Balber, who represents Aras and Emin Agalarov, the billionaire real estate developer and his son who requested the June 2016 meeting.

The emails between Goldstone and Trump Jr. tell a different story, however. Goldstone wrote Trump Jr. saying the Russian government [wanted to help the Trump campaign](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/10/Day-172/#1-donald-trump-jr-met-with-a-kremlin) by providing documents that “[would incriminate Hillary](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/11/Day-173/#2-the-email-sent-to-trump-jr-said-th)" and "be very useful to your father.” Trump Jr. replied: “If it’s what you say I love it."

3/ **Trump is demanding funding for his border wall in exchange for signing legislation to provide legal status for "Dreamers."** The administration's list of hard-line immigration principles includes overhauling the country's green-card system, cracking down on unaccompanied minors entering the country, funding his wall along the southern border, and denial of federal grants to "sanctuary cities." Last month, Trump [rescinded](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/09/05/day-229/#1-trump-rescinded-daca-and-called-on) the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provides legal status for 800,000 young immigrants brought to the US illegally as children.

4/ **Trump [called](https://www.axios.com/trump-phones-schumer-for-help-on-health-care-miffing-some-in-gop-2493868663.html) Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in an effort to revive a deal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act**. Trump said he would be open to cutting a one-year or two-year deal with Democrats. “I told the president that’s off the table,” Schumer said in a statement. “If he wants to work together to improve the existing health care system, we Democrats are open to his suggestions.” ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-trump-deal/trump-says-open-to-temporary-healthcare-reform-deal-with-democrats-idUSKBN1CC0S9) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/trump-schumer-obamacare.html))

5/ **Bob Corker: Trump is treating his office like “a reality show” and his reckless threats could set the nation “on the path to World War III.”** The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee added that Trump acts “like he’s doing ‘The Apprentice’ or something.” On Sunday, Trump tweeted that Corker “didn’t have the guts” to run for re-election and that the Senator had “begged” for his endorsement. Corker responded on Twitter that it's "a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.” 

Last week, [Corker said](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/05/day-259/#6-rex-tillerson-james-mattis-and-ste) that Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, and John Kelly “help separate the country from chaos" and hopes they stay "because they're valuable to the national security of our nation." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/us/politics/trump-corker.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/10/08/trump-attacks-gop-sen-corker-didnt-have-the-guts-to-run-for-reelection/) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/08/trump-claims-corker-didnt-have-the-guts-to-run-for-reelection-243576))
