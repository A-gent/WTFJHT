1/ **Rex Tillerson called Trump a moron and nearly resigned**. The comment came this past summer after a meeting at the Pentagon with members of Trump’s national security team and Cabinet officials. Mike Pence reportedly counseled Tillerson on how to ease tensions with Trump, with other top administration officials urging him to remain in the job until the end of the year.

2/ **Tillerson denied he considered resigning from his job**. He did not address whether he called Trump a "moron." Minutes before Tillerson's remarks, Trump tweeted that NBC News was "fake news" and "more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!" Immediately after Tillerson spoke, Trump tweeted, again, that the NBC News "story has just been totally refuted" by Tillerson and that the news network "should issue an apology to AMERICA!"

3/ **Senate intelligence committee leaders will provide an update on their investigation into Russian election meddling and possible collusion with Trump associates**. Richard Burr and Mark Warner will publicly report on what the panel has confirmed regarding Russian meddling and "sound the alarm" about Trump's refusal to explicitly say Russia was responsible. They'll also provide steps that Congress can take to protect future elections as well as to prevent abuse of social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. The Senate intelligence committee is one of three congressional committees probing events related to Russia's election meddling and potential collusion between Trump's team and the Russian government. Also ongoing is the federal investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.  ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/04/politics/senate-intelligence-russia-news-conference/index.html))

4/ **Russian-linked Facebook ads specifically targeted Michigan and Wisconsin**, two states Trump won by less than 1% of the vote. The ads promoted divisiveness and anti-Muslim messages. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Michigan by about 10,700 votes out of nearly 4.8 million ballots cast. In Wisconsin, Trump won by only about 22,700 votes.

* **The House intelligence committee is focusing on Russian ads bought on Google**, search engine manipulation, fake news, and the potential uses of YouTube. Google had initially said it found no evidence of targeted tactics like the thousands of election-related ads purchased on Facebook.

* **Russia targeted NATO soldiers' smartphones in an effort to gain information about operations and troop strength in Poland and the Baltic states**. The campaign targeted a contingent of 4,000 NATO troops deployed this year to protect the alliance’s European border with Russia.

5/ **Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. avoided a criminal indictment in 2012 after Trump's personal lawyer met with the Manhattan District Attorney**. Marc Kasowitz donated $25,000 to District Attorney Cy Vance Jr.'s reelection campaign and three months later the case was dropped when the DA overruled his staff. The donation was returned, but less than six months later, Kasowitz made an even larger donation of more than $50,000 to Vance’s campaign. For two years, prosecutors had been building a criminal case against Ivanka and Trump Jr. for misleading prospective buyers of units in the Trump SoHo hotel, which included emails showing coordination about how to move forward giving false information to prospective buyers.

6/ **Kushner and Ivanka were both fined $200 for missing a deadline to submit financial disclosures** required by government ethics rules as part of a months-long process of divesting Kushner's stock and assets. It’s the second time that Kushner has been fined for late filing. In July, Kushner made his [39th change to his financial disclosure](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/22/day-184/#3-jared-kushner-and-ivanka-trump-fil).

* **Paul Manafort's son-in-law accused him of conspiring to mislead a federal bankruptcy court** about four California real estate investments. Jeffrey Yohai alleged that Manafort and others had misled him and the court about the funding and ownership of the companies that have proposed to clear up the bankruptcy issues.

7/ **The EPA will propose repealing the Clean Power Plan**, a central piece of Obama's plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants, fight climate change, and meet emissions goals promised in the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump signed an [executive order in March](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/03/28/Day-68/#3-trump-signs-an-executive-order-to) directing the EPA to start the legal process of withdrawing and rewriting the Clean Power Plan. The EPA will solicit input on “developing a rule similarly intended to reduce CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel electric utility generating units.”  ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-carbon-exclusive/exclusive-epa-to-propose-repealing-obamas-climate-regulation-document-idUSKCN1C90BY))

8/ **The DACA renewal deadline is Thursday. The Trump administration didn't notify immigrants about it**. [Jeff Sessions announced](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/09/05/day-229/#1-trump-rescinded-daca-and-called-on) on September 5th that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has provided renewable, two-year work permits to nearly 800,000 "dreamers," would end on March 5, 2018. Citizenship and Immigration Services had sent out notices prior to the announcement reminding DACA recipients they had 180 days to reapply. USCIS, however, never sent out corrections notifying immigrants that if they followed the instructions in the letter, they would miss the new deadline. About 154,000 DACA recipients are eligible for one last two-year extension, but must file their their application by the end of the day Thursday.
