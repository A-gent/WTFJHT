1/ **House Republicans unveiled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act**, which reduces the number of tax brackets from seven to five, maintains the top tax rate at 39.6%, raises the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals and from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples. The bill reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, repeals the state and local income tax deductions, limits the property tax deduction to $10,000, and expands the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600. Pre-tax contributions to 401(k) and IRA would be preserved. Homeowners can keep their mortgage interest deduction, but the bill caps the deduction for new mortgages of $500,000 or more, while also repealing the estate tax in 2024. The bill is estimated to cost $1.51 trillion over a decade, but lawmakers must keep the cost of the bill to $1.5 trillion if they want to pass it along party lines and avoid a filibuster by Democrats.

* **Trump wanted to call the tax plan the "Cut, Cut, Cut Act."** Paul Ryan initially asked the White House for input because of the Trump's knack for branding.

2/ **Sam Clovis has withdrawn his nomination for the Department of Agriculture's chief scientist role** after coming under criticism for his lack of science credentials (he's not a scientist) and for his role supervising George Papadopoulos. In a letter to Trump, Clovis wrote that he does "not want to be a distraction or a negative influence." Clovis is a self-described skeptic of climate change.

3/ **The Justice Department has identified at least six Russian government officials involved in the DNC hack** that resulted in thousands of emails being released by WikiLeaks last year. Prosecutors have assembled evidence to charge the Russian officials and could bring a case next year. U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed the hack to Russian intelligence services.

4/ **The hackers who targeted Hillary Clinton's campaign had international targets corresponding with Russian interests**. A digital "hit list" shows a multi-year operation that tried to break into the inboxes of 4,700 Gmail accounts worldwide and targeted the emails of Ukrainian officers, Russian opposition leaders, U.S. defense contractors, and more. The list was found by cybersecurity firm Secureworks after the "Fancy Bear" hacking group forgot to set an active Bitly account to private. One of the experts who reviewed the list described the data as "a master list of individuals whom Russia would like to spy on, embarrass, discredit or silence."

5/ **Rick Perry suggested that expanding the use of fossil fuels could help prevent sexual assault**. "From the standpoint of sexual assault," Perry said. "When the lights are on, when you have light that shines, the righteousness, if you will on those types of acts." The energy secretary also said that while he thinks climate change is real, "I still think the science is out on" whether humans are the cause of it.
