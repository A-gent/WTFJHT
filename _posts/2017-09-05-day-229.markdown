1/ **Trump rescinded DACA and called on Congress to replace the policy before it expires on March 5, 2018**. The Department of Homeland Security will no longer accept new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which has provided renewable, two-year work permits to nearly 800,000 dreamers. Jeff Sessions formally announced the shift of responsibility, saying DACA "was implemented unilaterally, to great controversy and legal concern.” He called the Obama-era policy an “open-ended circumvention of immigration laws” and an unconstitutional use of executive authority. “The executive branch through DACA deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative branch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions."

2/ **North Korea “is begging for war,” Nikki Haley told the Security Council**. The US ambassador to the United Nations' remark came a day after the North [successfully tested a miniaturized hydrogen bomb](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/world/asia/north-korea-tremor-possible-6th-nuclear-test.html) capable of fitting on an intercontinental ballistic missile, and hours after South Korean said they might be [preparing to launch another ballistic missile](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear/south-korea-seeks-bigger-warheads-north-korean-icbm-reportedly-on-the-move-idUSKCN1BD0VW). Defense Secretary James Mattis warned of a "massive military response" and the "total annihilation" of North Korea if it threatens to attack the US and its allies. Trump accused South Korea of "appeasement" toward North Korea and warned that the US could halt trade with North Korea's trade partners – an almost impossible threat given American dependence on Chinese imports.

* **Trump offered to sell Japan and South Korea more "sophisticated military equipment"** after Pyongyang said it tested a miniaturized hydrogen bomb that could be placed on an intercontinental ballistic missile.

3/ **The House and Senate intelligence committees are expected to conduct closed-door interviews with Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort and Trump Jr. in the coming weeks** now that Congress has returned from the August recess. The two panels could possibly hold public hearings this fall. In addition, Trump Jr. is set to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The three committees are competing for information and witnesses with little coordination between them and Mueller's investigation, leading to conflicts over how they can share information.

4/ **The Justice Department said that it has no evidence to support Trump's claim that Obama wiretapped the phones in Trump Tower**. The DOJ made the statement in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the watchdog group American Oversight. "Both FBI and NSD confirm that they have no records related to wiretaps as described by the March 4, 2017 tweets," the department's motion reads. On March 4, Trump, [citing no evidence](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/03/04/Day-44/#1-trump-citing-no-evidence-accuses-o), tweeted: "Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! How low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate."
