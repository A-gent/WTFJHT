1/ **The FBI said in a statement that it has "grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy."** FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein went to the White House on Monday in hopes of preventing the release of the memo, which was written by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. Wray told John Kelly that The Memo™ contains inaccurate information and paints a false narrative. Republicans in the House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines on Monday to release the memo, as well as voting against releasing the Democrats' 10-page point-by-point rebuttal of the document. Trump has five days to stop the release of the document, if he chooses to do so. While the FBI Director isn't part of the official White House review process, he was allowed to read the memo on Sunday.

2/ **Trump promised "100 percent" to release The Memo™** as he was leaving the House chamber following his first State of the Union address. C-SPAN cameras captured Rep. Jeff Duncan on a hot mic asking Trump to "release the memo." Trump replied: "Oh yeah, oh, don’t worry. 100 percent." This morning, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: "There are no current plans to release the House Intelligence Committee's memo" and that Trump had not "seen or been briefed" on the memo's contents. John Kelly, meanwhile, said the memo will "be released here pretty quick." The Justice Department previously warned that the memo's release could compromise intelligence gathering and threaten national security.([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trump-wants-to-release-memo-100-percent-as-white-house-tries-to-walk-it-back/2018/01/31/240f34a4-0690-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html))

3/ **Trump signed an executive order to keep Guantanamo Bay open**, prior to the start of his first State of the Union address. During the speech, Trump reiterated the Bush-era notion that suspected terrorists should be treated as "unlawful enemy combatants" instead of criminals. The majority of detainees held in the facility [were never charged with a crime](https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2017/03/30/guantanamo-facts-and-figures). Of the 41 detainees that remain at Guantanamo, only seven are facing any formal charges. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/30/trump-signs-executive-order-to-keep-guantanamo-bay-prison-open.html))

4/ **The director of the CDC resigned following a report that she purchased shares of tobacco stock after taking charge of the agency**. Brenda Fitzgerald bought the shares a month into her tenure as CDC director, where her mission was to convince smokers to quit and keep children from becoming addicted.
