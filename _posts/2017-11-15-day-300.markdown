1/ **Nearly 1.5 million people have signed up for an Affordable Care Act health care plan** in the first two weeks of open enrollment, outpacing last year's sign ups by nearly 500,000. The Trump administration cut the 2018 open enrollment period from 12 to six weeks, and reduced the ACA advertising budget by 90%.

2/ **The Trump administration rejected 4,000 "late" DACA renewals despite some applications sitting in its mailbox at the October 5th deadline**. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) only counted applications it had marked as "received" before the deadline. USCIS didÂ not honor the postmarked date. The plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the Trump administration allege that many more DACA renewal applications arrived on time to USCIS mailboxes, but were rejected as late anyway. The US Postal Service has taken responsibility for an "unintentional temporary mail processing delay" in New York, Chicago, and two other states.

3/ **Mitch McConnell proposed that Jeff Sessions could be run as a write-in candidate to replace Roy Moore** in the Alabama Senate race and reclaim his old seat. McConnell suggested that if Moore won the election, he could be sworn in but immediately subjected to an ethics investigation that would include his testifying under oath. Moore has made no public indication he plans to leave the race.

4/ **Trump tweeted condolences about the wrong mass shooting**. In the botched copy/paste job, Trump referenced the tragedy in Sutherland Springs, Texas from nine days ago while offering condolences for the shooting at the Rancho Tehema Elementary School in northern California. Roughly nine hours later the tweet was deleted without explanation.

5/ **Democrats introduced articles of impeachment against Trump**. The articles, introduced by five Democrats, accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, undermining the independence of the federal judiciary, and more. The effort faces long odds in the Republican-controlled House. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/58fbb83643e94baaa79a2f1d99a36f04/5-House-Dems-introduce-impeachment-articles-against-Trump))

poll/ **In a hypothetical matchup, Joe Biden would lead Trump by 11 points in the 2020 general election**. 46% of voters said they'd vote for Biden compared to 35% who would choose to reelect Trump. Biden has said he has "no plans" to run in 2020, but that it would be "foolish" to rule it out completely. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/15/biden-trump-2020-elections-244900))
