1/ **Republicans won't advance bills to protect Robert Mueller** and future special counsels, despite a report that Trump tried to fire Mueller last June. Two bipartisan bills under consideration would empower a panel of federal judges to review the case for firing the special counsel and determine whether there was good cause to do so. "It's pretty clear to me that everybody in the White House knows it would be the end of President Trump's presidency if he fired Mr. Mueller," Lindsey Graham said. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/us/politics/republicans-mueller-special-counsel-legislation.html))

2/ **FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is "stepping aside,"** but will remain on the FBI payroll until he is eligible to retire with full benefits in mid-March. Trump has accused McCabe of political bias and has repeatedly pressured him to step down.

3/ **Lawmakers in both parties are calling on Trump to drop his demands to slash legal immigration** and focus more narrowly on DREAMers and border security. Many lawmakers are worried that Trump's positions on legal immigration will sink a bipartisan deal. The White House's DACA plan proposes a path to citizenship for 1.8 million DREAMers in exchange for $25 billion for the border wall and cuts to family immigration visas.

4/ **Trump joined Republicans and called for the release of The Memoâ„¢**, despite his own Justice Department warning that releasing the memo to the public without an official review would be "extraordinarily reckless." The memo, written by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, suggests that the FBI was politically motivated or used questionable sources to justify its request for a secret surveillance warrant. Democrats said the memo inaccurately summarizes classified investigative materials and was designed to smear the FBI. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-sought-release-of-classified-russia-memo-putting-him-at-odds-with-justice-department/2018/01/27/a00f2a4c-02bb-11e8-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html?utm_term=.4a48b5492a69))

5/ **The deadline to implement the Russia sanctions is today**. In August Trump reluctantly signed the sanctions, which are designed to punish Moscow for meddling in the 2016 election, into law. The Treasury Department is required to produce a report on Putin-linked oligarchs and impose sanctions on entities doing business with Russia's defense and intelligence sectors. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/28/trump-russia-sanctions-deadline-373106))

6/ **Russia accused the US of meddling in its upcoming presidential election**. Moscow called the timing of the US Treasury report on Russian sanctions "a direct and obvious attempt" to interfere with the upcoming vote. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/29/europe/russia-accuses-us-of-election-meddling-intl/index.html))

7/ **Democrats are well-positioned to end one-party government in Washington in the November elections**. A Bloomberg analysis of historical data, election maps and public polling points to Democratic gains in the midterms, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate are on the ballot. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-midterm-elections-preview/))

* "Since the end of World War II, **the party in control of the White House has, on average, had a net loss of 26 House seats in midterm elections**. Democrats can win control of the House with a net gain of 24 seats in November. They'd need to win two seats to gain a majority in the Senate."

* "Trump's approval rating at this stage of his presidency, 36 percent, is lower than any of his predecessors going back to Harry Truman, according to Gallup polling data. **The less popular the president, the more seats his party tends to lose**."
