2/ **Trump rush-shipped condolence letters to military families last week** after he falsely claimed he had [called or written](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/18/day-272/#2-the-white-house-had-drafted-a-stat) letters to "virtually all" of the families. Four families of fallen soldiers received next-day UPS letters from Trump two days after Trump told the widow of a fallen soldier ["he knew what he signed up for."](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/18/day-272/#1-trump-denied-telling-the-widow-of) ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/donald-trump-is-rush-shipping-condolences-to-military-families/543606/))

Myeshia Johnson told "Good Morning America" she was "very angry at the tone of \[Trump's\] voice and couldn't remember my husband's name" during the same call where Trump said the solider "knew what he signed up for." Trump defended himself on Twitter, saying: "I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!"

4/ **Senators didn't know there were 1,000 troops in Niger**. Lindsey Graham, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said "I didn’t know there was a thousand troops in Niger" when asked about whether Congress needed to vote on an Authorization of Use of Military Force for the mission that left [four Green Berets dead](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/20/day-274/#6-the-fbi-has-joined-the-investigati). He added: "The military determines who the threats are, they come up with the engagement policy and if we don’t like what the military does, we can defund the operation." Chuck Schumer also admitted that he didn't know about the number of troops in Niger. ([The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/senators-are-stunned-to-discover-we-have-1000-troops-in-niger))

5/ **Trump dismissed the House Republicans' plan to limit 401(k) contributions** as part of their effort to rewrite the tax code. The plan could cap pre-tax 401(k) contributions at $2,400 annually. "There will be NO change to your 401(k)," Trump tweeted. "This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!" ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/trump-dismisses-401-changes-additional-bracket-for-tax-plan-idUSKBN1CS1IN) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/us/politics/republicans-tax-401-k.html))

* **Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee are considering retaining the income tax rate for people who earn $1 million or more per year**. The current thinking is that people who earn between $418,000 and $999,999 will have their tax rate reduced from 39.6% to 35%, but those earning $1 million or more will not.

6/ **The EPA blocked three agency scientists from discussing climate change at a conference**. The scientists contributed substantial material to a 400-page report about how climate change is affecting air and water temperatures, precipitation, sea level and fish in and around the Narragansett Bay estuary. The EPA helped fund the report. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/climate/epa-scientists.html))

* **Scott Pruitt's security detail is adding a dozen more agents** as the number of threats against the EPA head has increased "four to five times." Pruitt has also purchased a secure soundproof communications booth for his office at a cost of nearly $25,000, even though similar rooms already exist at the EPA. Congress has said the costs are a "potential waste or abuse of taxpayer dollars" and that "taxpayer funds are being misused."
