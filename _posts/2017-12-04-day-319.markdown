1/ **Trump tweeted that he fired Michael Flynn because he lied to the FBI**. "I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies," Trump tweeted. "It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!" Legal experts said the tweet is a public admission that Trump knew Flynn had lied to the FBI and possible motivation to obstruct justice. Trump asked if then-FBI Director James Comey could see "his way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go," according to notes Comey kept. Trump fired Comey in May.

* **A conservative operative offered the Trump campaign a "Kremlin Connect"** by using an NRA convention to make "first contact."

2/ **Trump's lawyer said he wrote the tweet about firing Flynn**. John Dowd said he gave the "sloppy" drafted tweet to Trump's social media director Dan Scavino. The White House has insisted that Trump's tweets should be taken as official statements. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-lawyer-wrote-presidents-sloppy-tweet-flynns-dismissal/story?id=51541650))

3/ **John Dowd claimed Trump "cannot obstruct justice,"** because he's responsible for the enforcement of the laws created by Congress and "has every right to express his view of any case." Dowd added: "The tweet did not admit obstruction. That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion."

4/ **The Senate Judiciary Committee is building an obstruction of justice case**, according to Dianne Feinstein, the panel's top Democrat. "I see it in the hyper-frenetic attitude of the White House, the comments every day, the continual tweets," Feinstein said. "And I see it most importantly in what happened with the firing of Director \[James\] Comey, and it is my belief that that is directly because he did not agree to ‘lift the cloud’ of the Russia investigation. That’s obstruction of justice." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/feinstein-senate-russia-probe-building-obstruction-case-against-trump-n826031))

5/ **Robert Mueller removed his top FBI agent this summer for sending anti-Trump text messages**. During the presidential campaign, Peter Strzok and another member of Mueller's team had exchanged texts disparaging Trump and supporting Hillary Clinton. At the time, Strzok was investigating Clinton's use of a private email server. Strzok left the Russia investigation in August.

6/ **Trump tweeted that the FBI's reputation is "in tatters" and its standing was now the "worst in history."** The tweet: "After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness." The head of FBI Agents Association said any suggestion that agents aren't dedicated to their jobs, "unwavering integrity and professionalism" is "simply false."

7/ **The Russia investigation is "wearing" on the White House and \
"everyone thinks they're being recorded."** Michael Flynn's plea is the closest that Robert Mueller's probe into Russian meddling and collusion has come to the Oval Office. It was a dramatic step for an investigation that has infuriated Trump since its creation. Flynn spent countless hours briefing the businessman-turned-politician during the 2016 campaign and was Trump's top national security aide. Flynn's plea deal includes an agreement that he could avoid a potential lengthy jail term in part by "participating in covert law enforcement activities."
