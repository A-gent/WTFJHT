1/ **Trump tried to fire Robert Mueller in June, but backed down after Don McGahn threatened to quit if Trump went through with it.** After receiving the order from Trump, the White House counsel refused to ask the Justice Department to fire Mueller and said he would resign instead. Mueller learned about Trump's intention in recent months through interviews with current and former senior White House officials. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-moved-to-fire-mueller-in-june-bringing-white-house-counsel-to-the-brink-of-leaving/2018/01/25/9184a49e-0238-11e8-bb03-722769454f82_story.html?utm_term=.3a2d7d44c963))

2/ **Trump and his allies have repeatedly denied that Trump ever considered firing Mueller**. At least eight times since June 2017 Trump and his team have said Mueller's job was safe. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/25/politics/robert-mueller-donald-trump/index.html))

3/ **Mueller's investigation is moving much faster than previously thought**, and he appears to be wrapping up the part of the investigation that deals with possible obstruction of justice. Even if Mueller concludes the obstruction probe, other elements of the investigation are likely to continue for several more months. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-25/mueller-said-to-be-near-end-of-obstruction-part-of-trump-probe))

4/ **John Dowd said he is the one who will decide if Trump will sit down with Mueller.** The statement from Trump's attorney comes days after Trump said he would be glad to speak with Mueller and would do so under oath. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/25/politics/john-dowd-donald-trump-robert-mueller/index.html))

5/ **Trump's immigration proposal is DOA after Chuck Schumer opposed the framework released by the White House**. The one-page proposal would allow as many as 1.8 million young immigrants to become citizens in exchange for spending $25 billion on a border wall and security, as well as imposing restrictions on family-based immigration and eliminating the visa lottery system.
