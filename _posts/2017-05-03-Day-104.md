1/ **James Comey said he’s "mildly nauseous" at the suggestions he swayed the election**. The FBI director defended his "painful" decision on the Clinton email probe during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee today. "This was terrible," Comey said. "But honestly, it wouldn't change the decision," because failing to inform Congress would have required an “act of concealment" which would have been "catastrophic." Comey added that Russia is actively involved in trying to influence US politics, emboldened after the outcome of last year's election, because "this works."

2/ **A pair of Republican holdouts now back the health care bill**. The latest proposal provides $8 billion over five years to help about 160,000 people with pre-existing medical conditions afford coverage by putting "downward pressure" on premium costs. The total individual market claims over those five years will probably be about $500 billion, mostly from people with pre-existing conditions. Republicans are still two or three votes away from being able to guarantee passage, but are pushing for a vote sometime this week.

3/ **Trump’s national security adviser described his foreign policy approach as "disruptive."** H.R. McMaster said Trump’s unpredictable and unconventional ways could stabilize the Middle East, because Trump “does not have time to debate over doctrine.” Instead, he seeks to challenge failed policies of the past with a businessman’s results-oriented approach.

4/ **Trump weighs how to approach a Middle East conflict** while hosting Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas at the White House today. The conflict has eluded resolution for seven decades. Trump called it the “ultimate deal" and has tasked Jared Kushner with negotiating the peace agreement.

5/ **Trump was "directly involved" in the post-inauguration hunt for the rogue National Park Service tweeter**. A Freedom of Information Act request revealed that Trump was "concerned" about who used the National Park Service Twitter account to retweet a side-by-side comparisons of the crowds at the Trump and Obama inauguration ceremonies. The tweet was deleted. ([CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rogue-nps-twitter-account/){:target="_blank"})

6/ **Trump is expected to sign a long-awaited and highly controversial executive order on religious liberties** on Thursday – the National Day of Prayer. A draft of the order, which leaked in February, would establish broad exemptions and legal protections for people and groups to claim religious objections. Civil liberties groups claim it would allow for discrimination against LGBT Americans.

7/ **The NSA collected more than 151 million records of Americans' phone calls last year**, despite Congress limiting its ability to collect bulk phone records. Under the old system, the NSA collected  “billions of records per day."
