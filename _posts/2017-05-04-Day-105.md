1/ **House Republicans plan health care vote today with few votes to spare and no assessment of how much it will cost**. Republicans insist they've secured the 216 votes needed to pass their bill. About 15 Republicans are still on record rejecting the proposal and several others are undecided. House leaders can afford only 22 defections, since Democrats will vote en masse against the proposal. The measure to repeal Obamacare is still opposed by health care providers, patient advocates, and retirees.

* **What to know about today's House health care vote**. The House will vote on this version of the Affordable Care Act replacement without a Congressional Budget Office estimate, and therefore no idea what it costs, how many people it might help, or how many it might hurt.

2/ **A last-minute amendment to the health care bill would allow states to waive 10 essential benefits** and potentially impact everyone not insured by Medicare or small-business plans. People who obtain health insurance through their employers could be at risk of losing protections that limit out-of-pocket costs for catastrophic illnesses, maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health treatment, and hospitalization.

3/ **The GOP health bill will cut special education funding by 25%**. The $880 billion in cuts over the next 10 years would effectively "convert Medicaid from an entitlement designed to cover any costs incurred to a more limited program.” Republicans say the cuts are necessary due to skyrocketing health care costs.

4/ **Health care bill will exempt members of Congress and their staffs from losing popular Obamacare provisions**. The amendment would ensure that staffers continue to have access to Obamacare programs, like a ban on discriminating based on preexisting conditions, while other enrollees could lose those policies if their state applied for a waiver. A Republican legislator has vowed to close the loophole in separate legislation. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/331867-republicans-can-exempt-themselves-from-obamacare-rollbacks-in-new-legislation?rnd=1493866040) / [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2017/4/25/15429982/gop-exemption-ahca-amendment))

5/ **Tillerson is asking State Department employees to weigh in on the agency's budget cuts**. The Trump administration wants to cut State Department budget by 26% for "efficiency improvements." ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/02/politics/tillerson-state-department-letter-staff-cuts/) / [CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rex-tillerson-state-department-changes/))

* **Tillerson said that the US had been too accommodating to emerging nations and longtime allies** and that “things have gotten out of balance.” Fulfilling Trump’s promise to put “America first" will right those imbalances. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/rex-tillerson-state-department.html))

6/ **Sean Spicer debates the press over the definition of a wall**. Spicer got into a heated back-and-forth with a Breitbart correspondent after he asked whether the Trump administration had lied to the public when he promised to build a concrete wall along the southern border, only to downgrade his proposal to a series of fence-like boundaries. The issue is over the definition of whether a “levee wall” or a “bollard wall” is more of a fence than a wall. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/03/sean-spicer-border-wall-fence))

7/ **Trump called out Susan Rice for refusing to testify** before a Senate committee investigating both Russian meddling in the 2016 election and allegations of Obama-era spying on Team Trump. Rice’s lawyer said she was declining to appear because the ranking Democratic member on the subcommittee did not agree Rice should testify, thereby making the request “a significant departure from the bipartisan invitations extended to other witnesses.” ([Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/04/trump-calls-out-rice-for-refusal-to-testify-to-congress.html))

* **Susan Rice declined to testify before Senate subcommittee on Russian hacking**. Republicans have raised concerns that Rice may have acted improperly, but GOP and Democratic lawmakers so far have found no evidence of wrongdoing. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/03/politics/susan-rice-refuses-graham-russia-hearing/) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/03/susan-rice-testify-237947))
