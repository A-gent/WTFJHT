1/ **Two intelligence chiefs repeatedly refused to say whether Trump asked them to intervene in the Russia probe** during their public Senate intelligence committee testimony. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers declined to discuss the specifics of private conversations they had with Trump and whether they had been asked to push back against an FBI probe into collusion between the campaign and the Russian government. Both hinted that they would  share more information with senators privately.

2/ **Trump asked Dan Coats if he could get Comey's Russia probe to back off** its investigation into Michael Flynn. The director of national intelligence chose not to step in, citing Trump's prodding as inappropriate.

3/ **Comey's role in the Russia probe has Trump "infuriated at a deep-gut, personal level,"** Newt Gingrich said. "He's not going to let some guy like that smear him without punching him as hard as he can."

4/ **Comey told Jeff Sessions he did not want to be left alone with Trump** after the president pressured him to end his investigation into Michael Flynn. Comey confronted Sessions after the encounter, believing that the Justice Department should protect the FBI from White House influence, which it typically does to avoid the appearance of political meddling in law enforcement.

5/ **Jeff Sessions offered to resign after a series of heated exchanges with Trump**.

7/ **Eric Trump says Democrats are "not even people"** in <s>an interview</s> tirade with Sean Hannity. "I’ve never seen hatred like this. To me, they’re not even people. It’s so, so sad. Morality’s just gone, morals have flown out the window, and we deserve so much better than this as a country. You see the Democratic Party, they’re imploding. They’re imploding. They became obstructionists because they have no message of their own," he said before added that the head of the Democratic National Committee a "total whack job."
