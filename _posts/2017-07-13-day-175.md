1/ **Senate Republicans released their new Obamacare repeal bill**. The new bill would maintain some Obamacare taxes on the wealthy, provide new financial support to help low-income people purchase health insurance, allow people to pay for insurance with pre-tax money, and spend billions more to fight opioid addiction. The plan also includes an amendment from Ted Cruz to win over conservatives aimed at building enough GOP support to open debate on the bill next week, but it's not clear if the votes will be there. The  Cruz amendment would allow insurers offering Obamacare plans to also offer cheap, deregulated policies meant to appeal to conservatives. The change could drive away moderates who are concerned the amendment would cause premiums to spike for those with pre-existing conditions.

2/ **Trump threatened to get "very angry" if Republicans fail to pass the health care bill**. "I don't even want to talk about it because I think it would be very bad," Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network. “I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand, waiting for our senators to give it to me." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-i-will-be-very-angry-if-gop-senators-dont-pass-a-health-care-bill/2017/07/12/cad615ae-673b-11e7-a1d7-9a32c91c6f40_story.html) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/12/politics/trump-anger-health-care/index.html))

3/ **The DOJ issued a mostly blank security clearance form detailing Jeff Sessions’ contacts with the Russians**. The  form shows he denied having any contact with foreign governments or their representatives in the past seven years. The page, used to apply for a security clearance, was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.

* **Sessions gave a closed-door speech to a Christian religious freedom advocacy group known for its anti-gay stance**. The "Summit on Religious Liberty" was hosted by the Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, claiming that to do so would violate his right to religious liberty under the Constitution. That case will be heard by the Supreme Court next term. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/12/politics/jeff-sessions-alliance-defending-freedom-summit/index.html))

5/ **Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed the White House is "as transparent as humanly possible" in an off-camera briefing**. “Every single day we do our very best to give you the most accurate information that we have,” Sanders said in response to a question about why so many members of the administration have not divulged meetings they had with Russian individuals.

7/ **Pence’s press secretary repeatedly refused to say if the VP had met with any Russians during the campaign**. "Clear up a few things for us now. Did the vice president ever meet with representative from Russia?” Bill Hemmer, host of Fox News' "America’s Newsroom," asked. “The vice president is not focused on the areas where, you know, on this campaign, especially things that happened before he was even on the ticket. As he has said, that when he joined the campaign his entire focus was on talking to the American people, taking the case that President Trump was going to make to the American people,” Pence’s spokesman Marc Lotter replied.

8/ **Trump’s friend Jim may not exist**. Throughout the campaign, Trump mentioned a friend named Jim while linking immigration policies in Europe to increased terrorist attacks, particularly those in France. Trump has never given his last name. The White House has not responded about who Jim is or whether he will be on Trump's trip to Paris. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/e18f254c4ac84e6bab4ceed56401cc65/Trump-in-Paris:-The-curious-case-of-his-friend-Jim) / [HuffPost](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-friend-jim-paris_us_59676a90e4b0a8d46d1263ad) / [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/who-is-trumps-friend-jim))

9/ **Trump claimed he's "done more in five months than practically any president in history."** He added that the current mood in the White House is "fantastic," despite recent pressure following allegations of Trump Jr.'s involvement with Russia during last year's election campaign. ([CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/13/trump-ive-done-more-in-five-months-than-practically-any-president-in-history.html))

10/ **Kellyanne Conway used flash card props to explain the Russia controvery** and how the White House viewed the scrutiny about Trump's associates' ties to Russia during the campaign during a _Hannity_  apperance. "What's the conclusion? Collusion? No. We don't have that yet. I see illusion and delusion," Conway said.
