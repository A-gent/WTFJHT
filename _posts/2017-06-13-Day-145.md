1/ **Russian hackers hit election systems in 39 states**, accessing software designed to be used by poll workers on Election Day. The scope and sophistication was so concerning that the Obama administration complained directly to Moscow, detailing Russia’s role in the election meddling and warned that the attacks risked setting off a broader conflict.

2/ **Senate leaders agree on bipartisan sanctions to punish Russia for election meddling**, placing the White House in an uncomfortable position. The agreement would impose sanctions on “corrupt Russian actors" and people conducting “malicious cyberactivity on behalf of the Russian government," and “provide for a mandated congressional review” if the White House sought to waive or ease existing sanctions unilaterally. “I’d be very, very surprised if the president vetoes this bill,” the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee said.

3/ **The House Intelligence Committee is adding funding and staff to its Russia probe**. A lack of resources has been an issue for the House investigation, due in part to Devin Nunes,the panel’s chairman, being forced to recuse himself over allegations that he was openly colluding with the White House.

4/ **Trump is considering firing Robert Mueller**, the special counsel investigating possible ties between his campaign and Russian officials. Trump was "considering, perhaps, terminating the special counsel," Trump's friend Christopher Ruddy said. To do so, Trump would have to order Rod Rosenstein to rescind department regulations protecting a special counsel from being fired and then to fire Mueller. If Rosenstein refused, Trump could fire him, too. Trump is being counseled to steer clear of such a dramatic move like firing the special counsel.

* **Republicans tell Trump not to mess with Mueller**. Mueller’s investigation is considered the most threatening to Trump’s presidency and is largely out of his control. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/12/republicans-robert-mueller-trump-239460))

5/ **Rod Rosenstein: only he has the power to fire the special counsel on Russia**. During testimony before the appropriations committee, Rosenstein said he would only comply with "lawful and appropriate" requests. Rosenstein added that there's no cause to fire Mueller and that he's "confident" the special counsel has full independence.

6/ **Jeff Sessions asked congressional leaders to undo federal medical marijuana protections so he could prosecute providers**. Research strongly suggests that cracking down on medical marijuana laws could make the opiate epidemic even worse.

7/ **Senate Republicans are trying to rein in expectations for their Obamacare repeal effort**, worried they'll blow their July 4th deadline or fall short of 50 votes. Senators continue to raise doubts about coming to an agreement, even though McConnell has said that "failure is not an option."
