1/ **Steve Bannon called the Trump Tower meeting with Russians "treasonous," "unpatriotic," and "bad shit."** He added: "The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower ... with no lawyers... You should have called the FBI immediately." Bannon's comments come from forthcoming book the *Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House*, by Michael Wolff.

3/ **Fusion GPS defended the dossier of alleged Trump-Russia ties** and called on Republicans to release the firm's testimony. "The attack on our firm," the Fusion GPS founders wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed, "is a diversionary tactic by Republicans who don't want to investigate Donald Trump's ties to Russia." Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch write they hired Christopher Steele to investigate Trump's repeated efforts "to do deals in a notoriously corrupt police state that most serious investors shun." They added: "As we told the Senate Judiciary Committee in August, our sources said the dossier was taken so seriously because it corroborated reports the \[FBI\] had received from other sources, including one inside the Trump camp," referring to a [drunk George Papadopoulos](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/01/02/day-348/#1-a-drunk-george-papadopoulos-bragge) who bragged about Russia having political dirt on Hillary Clinton to one of Australia's top diplomats.

4/ **Trump tweets that the "corrupt media awards" will be presented to the "fake news media" next week**. In November, Trump suggested there should be a contest among news networks, except for Fox News, for a "Fake News Trophy." A [Rasmussen poll](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/november_2017/the_winner_of_the_1st_annual_fake_news_trophy_is) conducted after Trump's suggestion found that most Americans would award Fox News the trophy. "THE MOST DISHONEST AND CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR" will be presented Monday at 5:00 pm ET.
