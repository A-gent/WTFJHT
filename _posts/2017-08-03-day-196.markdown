1/ **Trump urged the Mexican president to stop publicly saying that he would never pay for the border wall**, during their [January 27 call](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/27/Day-8/#9-trump-blows-up-the-u-s-mexico-rela). “You cannot say that to the press,” Trump repeatedly told Enrique Peña Nieto. “If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that."

The next day, [Trump called Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/02/02/Day-14/#1-trump-badgered-bragged-and-abruptl), which was even more contentious and the conversation immediately devolved over a US agreement to accept refugees from Australian detention centers. “I hate taking these people,” Trump said. “I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/you-cannot-say-that-to-the-press-trump-urged-mexican-president-to-end-his-public-defiance-on-border-wall-transcript-reveals/2017/08/03/0c2c0a4e-7610-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html))

2/ **The Senate Judiciary Committee is introducing a bipartisan bill to protect Robert Mueller** and ensure the integrity of independent investigations. The bill would allow any special counsel for the Department of Justice to challenge their removal in court, with a review by a three-judge panel within 14 days of the challenge. Lindsey Graham said that he was working on a similar bill that would prevent the firing of a special counsel without judicial review.

3/ **Congressional investigators want the phone records related to Trump Jr.'s meeting with the Russian lawyer**. They want "all relevant documents" connected to the people before, during, and after the meeting, including Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort. It's unclear if it's the Senate Intelligence Committee or the House Intelligence Committee seeking the records. Senator James Risch, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, "I guarantee you there were phone calls in addition to those emails, and I want to hear all of it before I answer the question you put to me."

4/ **Trump criticized his military advisers because "we aren't winning, we are losing" the Afghanistan war**. Trump directed his frustration at Defense Secretary James Mattis, saying Trump had given the military authority months ago to make advances in Afghanistan and yet the US was continuing to lose ground.

5/ **The White House conceded that the Boy Scouts never called to say his was the best speech ever**. Trump told the Wall Street Journal last week that “I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them, and they were very thankful.” The Boy Scouts of America, however, said it was not aware of any call from its leadership to Trump. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, however, said that "multiple members of the Boy Scouts leadership” had praised Trump’s speech, but the conversations "simply didn’t take place over a phone call, they happened in person.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/us/politics/those-calls-to-trump-white-house-admits-they-didnt-happen.html))

6/ **Stephen Miller told CNN's Jim Acosta that his question "is one of the most outrageous, insulting, ignorant and foolish things you’ve ever said."** The White House senior policy adviser was responding a question about Trump's endorsement of a Senate bill that seeks to cut legal immigration to the US in half. He accused Acosta of "cosmopolitan bias" before apologizing "if things got heated."

7/ **Federal prosecutors subpoenaed Kushner Cos. for its use of an investment-for-immigration program**. The company drew attention in May for a marketing campaign that solicited Chinese investors to put up $500,000 for green card eligibility, known as the EB-5 program. The campaign mentioned Jared Kushner and used a video clip and photo of Trump in its pitch.
