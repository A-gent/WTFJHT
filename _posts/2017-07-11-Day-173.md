1/ **Trump Jr. was told in an email the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign**. The email was sent by Rob Goldstone, who brokered the June 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, that promised damaging information about Clinton as part of a Russian government effort to aid the Trump campaign. The meeting took place less than a week before thousands of DNC emails were released by hackers. Goldstone is a publicist that represents a Russian pop star, whose father, Aras Agalarov, helped bring Trump's 2013 Miss Universe pageant to Moscow. Agalarovis is also a close friend of Putin.

* **Senators responded to Trump Jr.'s emails**. Lindsey Graham called them "disturbing" and "very problematic," while Tim Kaine suggested Trump Jr. may have committed treason. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/tim-kaine-donald-trump-jr/index.html) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/341460-graham-trump-jr-emails-disturbing-and-very-problematic))

* **Trump's deputy assistant shrugged the news off**. Sebastian Gorka said that getting dirt "is what political campaigns do." ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/sebastian-gorka-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer-cnntv/index.html))

* **Trump Jr. may have crossed the legal line on collusion**, a white-collar lawyer who represented officials in the Clinton White House said. Jeffrey Jacobovitz said the emails are firm evidence that Trump Jr. had intent to commit a crime by conspiring with the Russians "to commit election fraud or conspiracy to obtain information from a foreign adversary,” he said. “You cannot benefit from a foreign adversary in this kind of scenario.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/07/11/donald-trump-jr-may-have-just-crossed-the-legal-line-on-collusion/))

2/ **The email sent to Trump Jr. said the documents “would incriminate Hillary" and "would be very useful to your father.”** Within minutes, Trump Jr. replied: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer." Four days later, Goldstone wrote back proposing a meeting with a “Russian government attorney.” Trump Jr. agreed, saying he would bring “Paul Manafort (campaign boss)” and “my brother-in-law,” Jared Kushner, now one of the president’s closest White House advisers. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/trump-russia-email-clinton.html))

3/ **Trump Jr. tweeted out the email chain used to setup the meeting with the Russian lawyer**. “To everyone, in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails," he wrote. “I first wanted to just have a phone call but when that didn’t work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. [...] To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue."

4/ **The White House said Trump didn't know about his son's meeting with the Russian lawyer**. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump learned of the meeting "in the last couple of days," adding that Trump Jr. "did not collude with anybody to influence the election." Kellyanne Conway denied evidence of collusion, saying "everybody is trying to convert wishful thinking into hard evidence and haven't been able to do that." ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/trump-knowledge-meeting-natalia-veselnitskaya/index.html) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/10/donald-trump-jr-russia-lawyer-meeting-kellyanne-conway-240354) / [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-learned-sons-meeting-russian-attorney-couple-days/story?id=48553265))

* **Ten times Trump denied collusion with Russia**. We can count at least 10 times when President Trump has directly said there was no collusion between Russia and his 2016 campaign. ([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/ten-times-trump-denied-collusion-russia-n781656))

5/ **The Russian lawyer denied having any connection to the Kremlin or damaging information on Clinton**. Veselnitskaya said she met with Trump Jr. in 2016 to discuss sanctions between Russia and the US. “I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that,” Veselnitskaya said. “It is quite possible that maybe they were longing for such an information. They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted.” Trump Jr. has confirmed that the meeting occurred, saying the topic of conversation was primarily about adoption.

6/ **The man connecting Trump Jr. to the Russian lawyer checked in for the meeting on Facebook**. A screenshot from Rob Goldstone's Facebook page suggests he was at Trump Tower the day of the meeting. The caption says “preparing for meeting.” ([Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/goldstone-emails-about-clinton-and-russia-checks-in-for-the-meeting-2017-7))

7/ **Trump's election commission freezes its effort to gather voter data from states as legal challenges grow**. The panel's designated officer, Andrew Kossack, asked state elections officers to "hold on submitting any data." The panel asked states for voter data, including birth dates and the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers. Most US states have rejected full compliance, which many called unnecessary and a violation of privacy. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-vote-idUSKBN19V29W))

8/ **Mitch McConnell delayed the Senate's August recess in order to "complete action on important legislative items."** The move comes as McConnell aims to pass the GOP health care bill, which has been "stalled by a lack of cooperation from our friends across the aisle." D<span style="font-size: 1rem;">isagreements within the caucus centers on a conservative proposal from Mike Lee and Ted Cruz,&nbsp;</span>which would allow the sale of cheap insurance plans outside Obamacare’s regulatory structure. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">The next of the revised bill could be unveiled to as soon as Thursday, with a Congressional Budget Office score likely to follow as soon as Monday.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The Senate will remain at work through the week of August 7th.

9/ **The federal government cancelled the decade-long search for a new FBI headquarters**. The General Services Administration originally planned to trade away the Hoover Building to a real estate developer and then use nearly $2 billion in taxpayer money to cover the remaining cost. Dysfunction and escalating costs mired the project, and the lack of leadership at both the FBI and the GSA have hindered the case for funding. Trump’s appointee to the FBI, Christopher Wray, has not been confirmed, and Trump has not appointed a permanent GSA administrator. The GSA is also the landlord to Trump's DC hotel. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2017/07/10/e25c1080-65af-11e7-9928-22d00a47778f_story.html))
