1/ **Robert Mueller obtained "many tens of thousands" of Trump transition emails**, including the emails of Jared Kushner and 11 others. The emails came from the General Services Administration, which hosted the transition email system, and include exchanges about potential appointments, gossip about senators, vulnerabilities of Trump nominees, PR strategies, and policy planning.

2/ **A lawyer from Trump's transition team accused Robert Mueller of unlawfully obtaining the emails** in a seven-page letter sent to the House and Senate oversight committees. Kory Langhofer argued that the General Services Administration "unlawfully produced" emails which were subject to attorney-client privilege. Peter Carr, a spokesman from Mueller's office, said: "When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner's consent or appropriate criminal process."
