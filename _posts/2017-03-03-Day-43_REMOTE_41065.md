1/ **Moscow blames anti-Russian hysteria in the U.S. for Sessions’s plight**, saying "fake news" and a "witch hunt" are intended to head off better relations. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/moscow-blames-anti-russian-hysteria-for-sessionss-plight/2017/03/03/081e94e8-0000-11e7-a51a-e16b4bcc6644_story.html){:target="_blank"})

2/ **Trump cries "total witch hunt" as questions about Russia pile up** as to why so many people had so many meetings with Russians that they all forgot about. ([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/trump-cries-witch-hunt-russia-questions-pile-n728611){:target="_blank"})

3/ **Trump’s blaming the Democrats for Cabinet delays that are normal — and his own fault**. It is true that, at one time, Senate Democrats were dragging their heels on Trump’s Cabinet picks. Two of the main problems are that Trump's pick for Secretary of Labor withdrew last month and his pick to run the Department of Agriculture *hasn't been sent to the Senate yet*.([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/03/trump-is-blaming-the-democrats-for-cabinet-delays-that-are-normal-and-his-own-fault/){:target="_blank"})

4/ **Sessions used campaign funds for RNC trip, where he met Russian ambassador for "official" reasons**. Records show the attorney general used campaign account for travel expenses to Cleveland, where he met the Russian envoy and spoke about Trump’s campaign at the event. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeff-sessions-used-political-funds-for-republican-convention-expenses-1488509301){:target="_blank"})

5/ **Trump's advisers are urging him to purge the government of Obama appointees**. Frustrated by the gush of leaks, the president's allies say it's time to take action and install people who are loyal to him, amid a cascade of damaging stories that have put his nascent administration in seemingly constant crisis-control mode. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-obama-appointees-advisers-purge-235629){:target="_blank"})

6/ **The GOP's bold prediction: Obamacare repeal will pass this month**. Trump is reportedly on board, which suggests the House is poised to steamroll conservative opposition by daring their constituents to vote against an Obamacare repeal.

7/ **NC man accused of committing anti-gay attack: "You live in Trump country now."** A man on a scooter rode bumped a couple riding bikes, knocking one over. He accused them of voting for Clinton. He was then arrested on an extraditable warrant for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon with evidence of prejudice.

8/ **A St. Louis man was arrested for making at least eight threats against Jewish community centers**. The man allegedly made threatening calls to Jewish groups in his name or the name of his ex-lover. Federal prosecutors called it a “campaign to harass and intimidate.” ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/US/man-accused-making-threats-jewish-community-centers-arrested/story?id=45884069))

9/ **Trump tried Twitter discipline this week. He decided it’s totally overrated**. For precisely four days, eight hours and five minutes, Trump refrained from tweeting anything inflammatory. He finally succumbed Thursday night to the urge to vent his anger and reverted to form, tweeting Democrats “have lost their grip on reality,” he railed against a “witch hunt,” and insisted yet again that the “real story” is leaks. He was back on Friday morning, airing another grievance about another subject: accusing Democrats for not approving his full Cabinet.
