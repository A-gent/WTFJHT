The text of a new bill is likely to circulate by the weekend with intentions to have a vote by midweek before the president reaches his 100-day mark.

5/ **Carter Page's trip to Russia last July became the catalyst for an FBI investigation** into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. In 2013, a Russian spy was trying to recruit Trump's former foreign policy adviser, and his 2016 trip further stir the agency's interest in the businessman.
