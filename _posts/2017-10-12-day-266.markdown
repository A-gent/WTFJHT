1/ **Trump signed an executive order easing some Affordable Care Act rules** for small businesses that band together to buy health insurance as an association. The order will also lift limits on limited coverage, short-term insurance, and expand ways workers could use employer-funded accounts to buy their own insurance policies. Critics say that by relaxing standards, Trump would be creating low-cost insurance options for healthier, younger consumers, which would result in higher costs for the sick and potentially destabilize the ACA insurance marketplace.

* **How Trump’s executive order undermines the Affordable Care Act**. Trump is asking federal agencies to look for ways to expand the use of association health plans, groups of small businesses that pool together to buy health insurance, and to broaden the definition of short-term insurance, which is exempt from the Affordable Care Act’s rules.

2/ **Trump on NAFTA: "We’ll see what happens."** Justin Trudeau visited the White House yesterday in hopes of seeking a “fairer trade” deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The US Chamber of Commerce president said that abandoning the agreement would pose an “existential threat” to the continent’s national and economic security. Trudeau told members of the House Ways and Means Committee that he was worried about “poison pills,” proposals the US might make that were designed to kill, not repair, the NAFTA agreement. Trump has called NAFTA a "disaster" and that "NAFTA will have to be terminated if we’re going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you can’t negotiate a good deal."

3/ **European allies and Republicans are pressuring Trump to preserve the Iran nuclear deal**. Trump is expected to decertify the nuclear deal tomorrow, despite his own cabinet saying that Iran has abided by the deal. Lawmakers have remained largely in the dark about what Trump's ultimate plan is. Congress, however, will have 60 days to pass legislation to reimpose sanctions on Iran if Trump decertifies the deal. Trump was reportedly "incensed" by the arguments  Rex ­Tillerson and Jim Mattis made when he certified [Iran's compliance in July](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/19/day-181/#11-trump-sanctioned-iran-a-day-after). “He threw a fit,” said one person familiar with the meeting. “. . . He was furious. Really furious. It’s clear he felt jammed.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/he-threw-a-fit-trumps-anger-over-iran-deal-forced-aides-to-scramble-for-a-compromise/2017/10/11/6218174c-ae94-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/mideast/white-house-briefs-congress-iran-decertification-decision-n809911) /  [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/12/politics/trump-iran-deal-certification-nuclear-weapon/index.html))

4/ **The US withdrew from UNESCO, citing anti-Israeli bias** from the United Nations cultural organization. The US hasn’t paid dues to UNESCO since 2011, when Obama stopped paying about $72 million a year when the organization accepted Palestine as a full member. The US also withdrew from the organization in 1984 but rejoined in 2003.

5/ **Trump tweeted that "we cannot keep" federal relief workers in Puerto Rico "forever."** As of earlier this week, 84% of the island remained without electricity, two-thirds of cellphone towers were down, and about 6,000 people were still in shelters. Trump tweeted the situation is a "total lack of accountability" and that the "electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes. Congress to decide how much to spend. We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!” ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/12/trump-puerto-rico-response-long-term-243705) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-warns-puerto-rico-weeks-after-storms-federal-help-cannot-stay-forever.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/10/12/trump-warns-puerto-rico-we-cannot-keep-fema-the-military-the-first-responders-forever/))
