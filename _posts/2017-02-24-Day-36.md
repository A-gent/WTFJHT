1/ **Trump to CPAC: "Now you finally have a president, finally."** In a wide-ranging speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump blasted the media for its coverage of his administration and promised that the Republican Party would “be the party of the American worker.” Trump said that in a matter of days, he would have “brand new action” to keep the country safe, a reference to a second attempt at an executive order to restrict travel into the country from several majority-Muslim nations. <mark>At one point the crowd started chanting “lock her up”</mark> after Trump derided Hillary Clinton for describing some of Trump's supporters as “deplorables.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/24/trump-to-become-first-president-since-reagan-to-address-annual-conservative-gathering/){:target="_blank"})

* **Trump intensified his slashing attack on the news media at CPAC**, reiterating his charge that “fake news” outlets are “the enemy of the people.” The opening portion of Trump's free-range, campaign-style speech centered on a declaration of war on the press — a new foil to replace vanquished political opponents like Hillary Clinton. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/us/politics/trump-conservative-political-action-conference-speech.html){:target="_blank"})

2/ **Republican lawmakers expect that their Obamacare replacement will result in fewer Americans covered by health insurance**. The new plan would do away with the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that all Americans have health coverage or pay a fine, and replace it with rules that let people choose not to buy insurance, instead paying higher premiums or penalties if they need it later. The result would be fewer people covered. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-24/gop-obamacare-plan-would-cover-fewer-people-blowback-grows){:target="_blank"})

* **Pence: "America’s Obamacare nightmare is about to end."** In a 21-minute speech, Pence ticked through issues on which the administration has acted or plans to act soon, including cutting taxes, rolling back regulations, ending illegal immigration, expanding the military and restoring what he termed the “culture of life.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/23/vp-pence-americas-obamacare-nightmare-is-about-to-end/){:target="_blank"})

3/ **Trump turned to manufacturing executives to help him develop measures to bring jobs back to the United States**, giving powerful business leaders a potentially influential hand in shaping his still-evolving economic policies. Trump has yet to outline specific proposals for overhauling the tax and regulatory systems, rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure or reshaping the work force, all of which would be essential to accomplishing his ambitious employment goals. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/us/politics/trump-manufacturing.html){:target="_blank"})

* **U.S. factory CEOs to Trump: Jobs exist; skills don’t**. They urged the White House to support vocational training for the high-tech skills that today’s manufacturers increasingly require — a topic Trump has seldom addressed. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/trump-meets-with-manufacturing-ceos/2017/02/23/6e511c5a-f9e7-11e6-aa1e-5f735ee31334_story.html){:target="_blank"})

4/ **Justice Department will use private prisons again**, reversing an Obama-era directive to stop using the facilities, which officials had then deemed less safe and less effective than those run by the government. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-will-again-use-private-prisons/2017/02/23/da395d02-fa0e-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html){:target="_blank"})

5/ **Trump administration signals a possible crackdown on states over legalized recreational-use marijuana**. Sean Spicer told reporters that the administration had no plans to continue the permissive approach of the Obama administration and that it viewed recreational marijuana use as a flagrant violation of federal law. ([Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-marijuana-20170223-story.html){:target="_blank"})

* **Roger Stone: Marijuana crackdown would be "huge mistake"**. Trump's longtime ally tweeted the president that a crackdown on legal marijuana in the states will cost thousands of jobs and bankrupt local governments. #StatesRights, yo.

6/ **Caitlyn Jenner to Trump: "Call Me" — your transgender restroom letter is a "disaster".** In a video the transgender icon harshly called out Trump for withdrawing the federal government's legal guidance on allowing transgender youths to use the restrooms of their choice in schools.

7/ **State Department writes anti-leak memo, which promptly leaks**. It's the latest sign that the relationship between the Trump administration's appointees and the State Department's professional workforce is still very much a work in progress.

8/ **Mexican officials tell US: We don't agree**. John Kelly and Rex Tillerson were in Mexico to try to smooth the relationship and address some of the differences that have emerged between the United States and its neighbor. Mexico ain't having it. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/politics/tillerson-kelly-mexico-statements/index.html){:target="_blank"})

9/ **He yelled "get out of my country," and then shot 2 men from India, killing one**. A 51-year-old man faces first-degree murder charges after shooting three men in an Olathe, Kansas bar Wednesday night. He reportedly told two local Garmin engineers from India to “get out of my country.” Authorities would not classify the shooting as a hate crime, but federal law enforcement officials are investigating with local police to determine if it was “bias motivated.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/24/get-out-of-my-country-kansan-reportedly-yelled-before-shooting-2-men-from-india-killing-one/){:target="_blank"})

([Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-cruz-ice-raid-20170223-story.html){:target="_blank"})

* **Here’s what non-fake news looks like**. Genuine news, and not fake news or hyped news or corrupt news, puts reality first; it does not subordinate honest reporting to ideological consistency or political advocacy.
