1/ **Trump put forward his strategy for resolving the nearly 16-year-old conflict in Afghanistan last night**. He insisted he would “not talk about numbers of troops” needed or telegraph military moves, but hinted that he supports the Pentagon’s proposal to add nearly 4,000 troops to the roughly 8,400 Americans there now. Trump also said the US will shift away from a time-based approach to a results-based approach, declining to specify the benchmarks for success or a timetable for withdrawal. He added, however, that there would be no “blank check” for Afghanistan and that “a hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for terrorists, including ISIS and Al Qaeda.” He described his plan as "principled realism."

2/ **Trump's national security team spent months talking him out of ending the war in Afghanistan**. “It wasn’t a debate,” said a senior White House aide. “It was an attempt to convince the president.” Trump's acceptance was less a change of heart than a willingness to be persuaded as long as he could be seen as a strong and decisive leader, even if it broke with his “America First” campaign rhetoric. “We are not nation-building again,” Trump said in his speech. “We are killing terrorists.” National security adviser H.R. McMaster used black-and-white photos from 1972 of Afghan women in miniskirts in an effort to convince Trump that Western norms had existed there before and could return.

3/ **The Treasury Department sanctioned China and Russia for assisting North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles**. Six individuals and 10 companies were added to the sanctions list in order to increase economic leverage on North Korea and reduce the flow of money to its weapons development.

4/ **Pro-Trump rallies in 36 states have been canceled**. The America First Rallies were scheduled for September 9th, but “out of an abundance of caution” due “to the recent violence in America and in Europe" the rallies will be held as online demonstrations because "citizens cannot peacefully express their opinion without risk of physical harm from terror groups domestic and international."

5/ **Paul Ryan said Trump “messed up” his response to Charlottesville** when he failed to denounce white supremacy and defended them as "fine people." Ryan said that by blaming "both sides" for last week's violence, Trump “made comments that are much more morally ambiguous, much more confusing” than he should have. He stopped short of calling on Trump to apologize for his Charlottesville response.

6/ **Pence: the US should be building more monuments, not tearing them down**. "I'm someone who believes in more monuments, not less monuments," Pence told Fox News. "What we ought to do is remember our history," arguing that America's monuments should tell the country's full history. "We ought to be celebrating the men and women who have helped our nation move towards a more perfect union and tell the whole story of America."

7/ **German police seized 5,000 Trump-shaped ecstasy tablets**, worth tens of thousands of euros. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/22/europe/germany-trump-ecstasy-pills/index.html))

8/ **In 214 days, Trump has made 1057 false and misleading claims**. Trump averages nearly five false claims a day and more than 30 of his misleading statements have been repeated three or more times. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/))
