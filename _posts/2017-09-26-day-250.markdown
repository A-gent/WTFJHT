1/ **The House Oversight Committee asked the White House for information about the use of private emails for government duties** by Jared Kushner and five other current and former senior aides. At least six of Trump’s closest advisers, including Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, Gary Cohn, Stephen Miller, and Ivanka Trump have used private email addresses to discuss White House matters. Elijah Cummings said the committee would examine whether administration officials were “deliberately trying to circumvent (federal) laws by using personal, private, or alias email addresses to conduct official government business.” Hillary Clinton called the revelation"the height of hypocrisy." It is not illegal for White House officials to use private email accounts so long as they forward work-related messages to their government accounts so the records can be preserved.

2/ **With Graham-Cassidy likely DOA, Senate Republicans are now discussing whether to merge another Obamacare repeal effort into tax reform**. They would use budget reconciliation, which would allow them pass legislation with just 50 votes. Republicans have two options: attempt to pass both health care and tax reform for the fiscal 2018 budget. Or, take up a budget for fiscal 2019 early next year and address an Obamacare repeal in that budget. Doing so would put health care back in the spotlight during the 2018 midterm elections. The CBO said the latest Senate health bill would cause millions of people to lose “comprehensive health insurance” over the next decade.

3/ **Roger Stone rejected all allegations of collusion between Trump's associates and Russia during the 2016 election**. In a closed House of Representatives Intelligence Committee hearing, Trump's longtime ally denied he had any contact with Russian operatives during the campaign. Stone also denied that he had any advance knowledge that emails of Clinton’s campaign chairman would be hacked and his emails released by WikiLeaks, despite tweeting days before that John Podesta’s “time in the barrel” would soon be coming.

4/ **Wisconsin's strict vote ID laws kept nearly 17,000 registered voters from the polls in the November election**. The November turnout in Wisconsin, 69.4% of eligible voters, was the lowest in a presidential election year since 2000. Trump defeated Clinton by 22,748 votes.

5/ **Trump will travel to Puerto Rico next week to survey damage from Hurricane Maria after tweeting that the Caribbean island was "broken"** and in "deep trouble" because of its outdated infrastructure and large debt that. San Juan's mayor responded to Trump, saying "you don't put debt above people, you put people above debt." Puerto Rico's governor said the island was on the brink of a “humanitarian crisis," stressing that the United States commonwealth deserved the same treatment as hurricane-ravaged states.
