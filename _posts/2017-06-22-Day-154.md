1/ **The Senate unveiled its health care bill**. It's similar to the House bill that passed last month, but with changes aimed at pleasing moderates: linking federal insurance subsidies to income, curbing Medicaid expansion, and ending the mandate that most Americans have health insurance. Mitch McConnell has vowed to hold a vote before senators go home for the July 4th recess, but he is still short the 50 votes he needs to pass the legislation.

2/ **Two of the top intelligence officials told Robert Mueller that Trump suggested they refute collusion with the Russians**. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers described the interaction as odd and uncomfortable, but that they don't believe Trump gave them orders to interfere. The two [repeatedly refused](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/06/07/Day-139/#1-two-intelligence-chiefs-repeatedly) to say whether Trump asked them to intervene in the Russia probe during their public Senate intelligence committee testimony.

3/ **Trump at Iowa rally: "All we do is win, win, win."** He then blamed Democrats for his problems, boasted about his "amazing progress," and called the Russia investigation a "phony witch hunt" at his campaign-style rally in Cedar Rapids last night. During the 70-minute speech, Trump promised to lay out the next steps in “our incredible movement to make America great again," but continually veered off on tangents, reflected on the past, and contradicted himself. He knocked trade deals the Iowa economy relies on, dismissed wind energy in a state filled with thousands of turbines, and denounced the war in the Middle East despite reauthorizing troops in Afghanistan. Trump also revealed his plan for putting solar panels on his proposed border wall "so it creates energy and pays for itself." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/us/politics/trump-iowa-rally-venting-session.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/06/22/with-a-raucous-rally-in-cedar-rapids-trump-transports-himself-back-to-2016/) / [CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-holds-campaign-style-rally-in-iowa/))

4/ **Trump: "I just don't want a poor person" in charge of the economy.**  "When you get the president of Goldman Sachs, smart," Trump told the crowd at his Cedar Rapids rally. During the campaign, Trump frequently bashed the investment bank for having too much influence in politics. Trump has one of the wealthiest Cabinets in history.

5/ **House Democrats want to suspend Jared Kushner's security clearance**. Kushner's previously undisclosed meetings with Russian officials have drawn the attention of investigators. Democrats say these contacts should be enough to suspend his access to sensitive information.

6/ **Betsy DeVos picked the CEO of a private student loan company to run the federal student loan system.** 42 million Americans currently owe $1.4 trillion in student loans.

7/ **Trump will host his first re-election fundraiser at the Trump International Hotel** next week, raising ethics concerns from conflict of interest attorneys. Trump is “becoming more and more brazen in his efforts to monetize the presidency,” Obama’s lead ethics attorney said.

8/ **North Korea called Trump a "psychopath"** and warned South Korea that no good will come from aligning with him. The commentary, published in a state newspaper, suggested that Trump could launch a preemptive strike on North Korea to distract from his domestic problems. ([AOL News](https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/06/22/north-korea-calls-trump-a-psychopath-warns-south-korea-against-following-white-house/22582088/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/06/22/north-korea-says-trump-is-a-psychopath-who-may-launch-a-preemptive-strike/))

poll/ **A majority of voters think the American Health Care Act would be harmful** for low-income Americans, people with pre-existing health conditions, and Medicaid recipients. 41% oppose the House plan, while 30% support it. 13% think the plan will improve the quality of their healthcare. 9% think it would make their health care cheaper.
