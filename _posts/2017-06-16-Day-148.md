1/ **Trump tweets that he's under investigation for his role in firing James Comey** and seemingly accused Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein of overseeing the "witch hunt" against him. Rosenstein wrote the memo recommending Comey's firing, but also approved the appointment of Robert Mueller, the special counsel now leading the Russia investigation.

* **The greatest threat to Trump and his presidency comes from his own conduct** and the obsessive behavior after he took office. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/15/trump-russia-investigation-obsession-239614))

2/ **Rod Rosenstein urged Americans to "exercise caution" when evaluating stories attributed to anonymous officials**. It's unclear why Rosenstein would suddenly issue the statement, but it follows several stories quoting unnamed sources on the direction of the Russia probe. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/16/rod-rosenstein-issues-cryptic-warning-about-truth-of-stories-attributed-to-anonymous-officials/))

3/ **Rosenstein privately acknowledged that he may have to recuse himself from the Russia investigation**. Rosenstein told Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand, the Justice Department's new third-in-command, that if he were to recuse himself, she would have to step in and take over the probe. She was sworn-in little more than a month ago. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/deputy-attorney-general-privately-acknowledges-recuse-russia-probe/story?id=48080253))

* **Former Bush official Rachel Brand takes over as the Justice Department’s third-highest-ranking official**. Brand was confirmed in May.

4/ **Jared Kushner's finances and business dealings are now part of the Mueller investigation**. Kushner joins the list of Trump associates Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, and Carter Page who are now being investigated by FBI agents and federal prosecutors. Kushner has agreed to discuss his Russian contacts with the Senate Intelligence Committee.

5/ **The Trump transition team was ordered to preserve Russia-related documents**, as well as records related to Ukraine and certain campaign advisers and officials. The memo says members “have a duty to preserve any physical and electronic records that may be related in any way to the subject matter of the pending investigations.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/us/politics/trump-transition-team-russia-inquiry.html) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/15/trump-transition-aides-volunteers-save-russia-documents-239624))

7/ **An American lobbyist representing Russian interests contradicted Jeff Sessions' sworn testimony** about not having contacts with lobbyists working for Russian interests over the course of Trump’s campaign. Richard Burt attended "two dinners with groups of former Republican foreign policy officials and Senator Sessions." ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/15/lobbyist-russian-interests-jeff-sessions-testimony))

8/ **Trump picked his family's event planner to run federal housing programs in New York**. Lynne Patton will oversee the distribution of billions of taxpayer dollars despite having no housing experience, and claiming to have a law degree the school says she never earned. ([NY Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-chooses-family-event-planner-run-n-y-housing-programs-article-1.3251314))

9/ **Senate Republican leaders want to bring their health care bill to the Senate floor by the end of June** even as lingering disagreements threaten to derail their efforts. Mitch McConnell and a small group of GOP aides are crafting the bill behind closed doors. Earlier this week Trump called the House version "mean," which has angered House Republicans and likely damaged his ability to negotiate with them on major items like infrastructure and tax reform. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gop-senate-leaders-aim-to-bring-health-care-legislation-to-the-floor-by-the-end-of-june/2017/06/15/29d26220-51d8-11e7-91eb-9611861a988f_story.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/hill-gop-stunned-disappointed-trump-called-their-bill-mean-2442335526.html)

poll/ **65% think Trump has little to no respect for country's institutions**. Only 34% of Americans think Trump has a great deal or a fair amount of respect for them. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/337899-poll-majority-thinks-trump-has-little-to-no-respect-for-countrys))
