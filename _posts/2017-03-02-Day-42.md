1/ **Top Republicans call on Sessions to recuse himself from Russia investigation**. Some Democrats have called on Sessions to resign and have demanded an independent investigation. The calls from two of the House’s most prominent Republicans follow revelations that Sessions met with the Russian ambassador during election season. Under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing in January, Sessions had said that he had not met with any Russian officials. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/top-gop-lawmaker-calls-on-sessions-to-recuse-himself-from-russia-investigation/2017/03/02/148c07ac-ff46-11e6-8ebe-6e0dbe4f2bca_story.html){:target="_blank"})

* **Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer say Sessions perjured himself and demand that he resign**. “For the good of the country, Attorney General Jeff Sessions should resign,” Schumer said. Pelosi took the same position: “Sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country and must resign. There must be an independent, bipartisan, outside commission to investigate the Trump political, personal and financial connections to the Russians.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/jeff-sessions-russia-trump-investigation-democrats.html){:target="_blank"})

> BACKGROUND:
> 
**Sessions met with Russians twice last year, but didn't disclose the encounters during his confirmation hearing** when asked about possible contacts between members of Trump’s campaign and representatives of Moscow.

2/ **Sessions: "I will recuse myself" if necessary**. Sessions confirmed he met with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before the presidential election in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee — not as a representative of the Trump campaign – and denied discussing the Trump campaign when he met with him. Kislyak is considered a top spy and is the same person who met with former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

3/ **Trump taps Putin critic for senior White House position** as Trump administration draws fire for contacts with Russian officials. ([Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/02/trump-taps-putin-critic-for-senior-white-house-position/){:target="_blank"})

4/ **Trump’s team nixed ethics course for White House staff** that would have provided training on leadership, ethics and management. The program could have better prepared officials for working within existing laws and executive orders, and provided guidance on how to navigate Senate confirmation for nominees and political appointees, how to deal with congressional and media scrutiny, and how to work with Congress and collaborate with agencies. Sounds boring. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-ethics-white-house-235586){:target="_blank"})

5/ **The White House intentionally misled reporters** ahead of Trump‘s congressional address in order to generate positive press coverage as part of a “misdirection play.” The White House indicated Trump would embrace a more moderate tone on immigration in his speech. He made no such remarks. CNN's Sara Murray called it a "bait-and-switch."

> BACKGROUND:
> 
**Trump went on background with reporters as a “senior administration official" ahead of his address to Congress night**. Trump has taken issue with the use of anonymous sources in stories about his administration, saying “They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name" on Friday. Four days later, he was one. ([BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/stevenperlberg/trump-gets-anonymity-after-dissing-anonymous-sources){:target="_blank"})

6/ **Some of the EPA's longstanding and best-known programs are facing potential elimination**. Details of an Office of Management and Budget proposal would cut the EPA's budget by 24% and reduce its staffing by 20%.

7/ **McMaster rolls back Flynn’s changes at NSC**. McMaster did away with two deputy assistant spots. It's unclear if Steve Bannon will stay on the principals committee of the NSC.

8/ **Ben Carson confirmed to lead HUD** despite no prior government experience and a staunchly conservative view of public assistance. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ben-carson-outsider-with-no-government-experience-confirmed-to-lead-hud/2017/03/02/326e5e8e-e8d3-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html){:target="_blank"})
