1/ **Jason Chaffetz asked the FBI to turn all documents it has on Trump and Comey's conversations**. The FBI has until May 24 to produce the records before the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee subpoenas them. Chaffetz said that if the [memo](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/05/16/Day-117/#1-trump-asked-james-comey-to-shut-do) exists and accurately reflects the conversation, "that seems like an extraordinary use of influence to try to shut down an investigation being done by the FBI."

2/ **Republicans and Democrats want Comey to testify** before Congress about his interactions with Trump, including whether Trump tried to obstruct the criminal probe into Michael Flynn. The collective political fallout from the past week “will make it difficult” for Republicans to resist a change in approach. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/17/trump-comey-testify-congress-reaction-238496) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/hill-republicans-show-growing-concern-over-trump-controversies/2017/05/16/57dd4f14-3aad-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html))

3/ **Democrats will try and force a vote to establish an independent probe of Russian interference in the US election**. A small but growing number of Republican lawmakers are predicting that the party will rally behind some sort of independent investigative body. “You’re watching an obstruction of justice investigation developing in real time,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "If there were ever any question about the need for an independent special prosecutor, this report is the nail on the argument." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/republican-senate-mcconnell-white-house.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/hill-republicans-show-growing-concern-over-trump-controversies/2017/05/16/57dd4f14-3aad-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html) / [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-idUSKCN18D1XT))

4/ **Paul Ryan tries to contain the political fallout** from the Comey memo by urging members to avoid "rushing to judgment." He called himself "a person who wants to get the facts" and said that "there are some people out there who want to harm the president." ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/17/politics/paul-ryan-news-conference/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/live-updates/trump-white-house/trump-comey-and-russia-how-key-washington-players-are-reacting/growing-chorus-of-republicans-want-comey-to-testify/) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/17/paul-ryan-donald-trump-investigation-238497))

5/ **McCain compares Comey memo about his meeting with Trump to Watergate**. "The only thing I can say is I think we’ve seen this movie before. I think it's reaching the point where it's of Watergate size and scale," McCain said. His advice to Trump is "the same thing that you advised Richard Nixon, which he didn’t do... get it all out... it’s not going to be over until every aspect of it is thoroughly examined and the American people make a judgment. And the longer you delay, the longer it’s going to last." ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-republican-senator-invokes-watergate-scandal-comey-memo/story?id=47459550) / [The Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2017/05/16/mccain-trump-scandal-has-hit-watergate-size))

6/ **Putin offers to provide Congress with the transcript to prove Trump didn't pass Russia secrets**, turning up the pressure on the White House to provide its own transcript of the meeting. Putin said Russia could hand over a transcript of Trump's meeting with Lavrov, if the Trump administration deemed it appropriate. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-putin-idUSKCN18D1EA) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/world/europe/trump-putin-russia.html) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/17/politics/russia-us-trump-lavrov-intel/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/putin-offers-to-provide-congress-with-details-of-trump-disclosures-to-russian-envoys/2017/05/17/80485ffe-3af6-11e7-a058-ddbb23c75d82_story.html))

7/ **Adam Schiff: "Last thing" Trump needs "is Putin vouching for him."** Schiff called Putin's offer "yet another twist in the road" and said, "all of this gets more baffling every day." ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/17/politics/adam-schiff-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-cnntv/index.html))
