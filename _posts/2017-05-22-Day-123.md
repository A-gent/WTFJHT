1/ **Michael Flynn will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination** as he notifies the Senate Intelligence committee that he will not comply with a subpoena seeking documents. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/aa3818ca3c844d46ad32bef19511ac73))

2/ **Trump's budget is expected to cut $1.7 trillion from Medicaid and anti-poverty programs** over the next 10 years. Assuming the GOP health care bill becomes law, the budget proposal will cut $800 billion from Medicaid leaving an estimated 10 million people without benefits. SNAP, the modern version of food stamps, will be reduced by $193 billion – about a quarter. During the campaign, Trump promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.

3/ **Comey believes that Donald Trump was trying to influence his judgment on the Russia probe**. He initially thought he could teach Trump and the White House what was appropriate during their communications, despite noting that the new President was not following normal protocols during their interactions.

4/ **Priebus and Bannon returned to Washington after Saudi visit**.

5/ **The White House is trying to block the disclosure of ethics waivers granted to former lobbyists** who work in the administration or federal agencies. Ethics watchdogs are concerned that former lobbyists are taking high-ranking political jobs working on the exact topics they had previously handled on behalf of private-sector clients — including oil and gas companies and Wall Street banks. The Office of Government Ethics was created in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal to oversee compliance with federal ethics standards. The administration is challenging the legal authority to demand the information. ([New York times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/us/politics/trump-white-house-government-ethics-lobbyists.html))

6/ **Sheriff David Clarke plagiarized portions of his master's thesis on homeland security**. Clarke will be joining Trump's administration as assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security. He denied the report, calling the journalist a "sleaze bag."

7/ **Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said he was pleased that there were no protesters** with "a bad placard" during his trip to Saudi Arabia. American-style protest is illegal in Saudi Arabia and can result in a death sentence.

8/ **McMaster won't say if Trump confronted Russian officials about election interference** during the meeting at the White House. He said "there already was too much that's been leaked from those meetings," but wouldn't deny that Trump called Comey "crazy, a real nut job."

9/ **The White House plans to ask a federal court for another 90-day delay in a lawsuit over Obamacare insurance subsidies**, leaving the future of the health care marketplaces in limbo through late August. The suit centers on Obamacare's cost-sharing program, which reimburses health insurers to help low-income people make co-payments at the doctor or hospital. House Republicans say the program was never legally funded in Obamacare and Trump has argued that the markets are fatally flawed and will collapse no matter what his administration does.
