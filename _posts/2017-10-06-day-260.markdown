3/ **Robert Mueller's investigators met with the author of the Trump dossier**, Christopher Steele, this past summer in an effort to understand if people associated with the Trump campaign and suspected Russian operatives broke any laws.

Trump and his allies have repeatedly called the dossier "totally made-up stuff" written by a "failed spy."
