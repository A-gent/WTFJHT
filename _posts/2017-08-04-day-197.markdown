1/ **Robert Mueller's grand jury issued subpoenas related to Trump Jr.'s 2016 meeting with the Russian lawyer in recent weeks**. The subpoena seeks both documents and testimony from people involved in the meeting. Yesterday, it was reported that [Mueller had convened a grand jury investigation in Washington](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/03/day-196/#1-special-counsel-robert-mueller-has) to examine allegations of Russian interference in the election. When Mueller took over the investigation in May, he inherited a grand jury in Alexandria, Va., which was impaneled to assist in the Michael Flynn investigation and focus on Flynn’s work in the private sector on behalf of foreign interests. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/us/politics/robert-mueller-russia-investigation-grand-jury.html) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/03/politics/mueller-grand-jury/index.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-idUSKBN1AJ1SW))

* **Michael Flynn filed an amended disclosure showing his link to Cambridge Analytica**, a controversial data analysis company that aided the Trump campaign. The disclosure shows that just before the end of the campaign, Flynn entered into a consulting agreement with SCL Group, a Virginia-based company related to Cambridge Analytica.

2/ **Trump used a campaign-style rally to attack the Russia investigation**, hours after news broke that special counsel Robert Mueller had tapped a grand jury. He referred to the investigation as a "totally made-up Russia story" and a "total fabrication." He insisted that Democrats "can't beat us at the voting booths, so they're trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want. They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us, and most importantly, demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution."

* **Kellyanne Conway tried to downplay the ongoing investigation**, saying “Let me remind everyone what the president has said about this. It's a witch-hunt. It's fake. Last night I believe \[Trump\] called it a fabrication. And we know that the nature of these types of investigations become fishing expeditions, where you’re just throwing jello up against the wall and hoping it will stick.” ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/04/trump-grand-jury-kellyanne-conway-reaction-241324?lo=ap_b1))

3/ **The Senate unanimously blocked Trump from being able to make recess appointments** during the August break. The Senate will hold nine "pro-forma" sessions — brief meetings that normally last roughly a minute – and will not hold any legislative sessions until lawmakers return to Washington after Labor Day. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/senate-blocks-trump-from-making-recess-appointments-2468906507.html) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/345261-senate-blocks-trump-from-making-recess-appointments-over-break))

* **The Senate breaks for summer recess**. There will be no more roll-call votes in the Senate until September 5th.

4/ **The Secret Service has left the Trump Tower** after a dispute between the government and Trump’s company over the terms of its lease. In March, the [Secret Service requested $26.8 million](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/03/22/Day-62/#11-the-secret-service-has-asked-for) to protect Trump Tower. Separately, [the government is paying $130,000 a month](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/19/day-181/#10-the-military-is-paying-130-000-a) to lease space in Trump Tower for a military office that supports the White House. Trump has not visited Trump Tower since he was inaugurated.

5/ **Jeff Sessions issued a warning that "culture of leaking must stop"** a day after [transcripts leaked](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/03/day-196/#7-trump-urged-the-mexican-president) of Trump's phone January calls with Mexico and Australia. Sessions wants to pursue "effective" subpoenas on media outlets, because "simply put, these leaks hurt our country."
