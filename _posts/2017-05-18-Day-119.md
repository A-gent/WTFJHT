1/ **The Trump campaign had at least 18 undisclosed contacts with Russians** during the last seven months of the election. Six of the previously undisclosed contacts were phone calls between Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US, and Trump advisers, including Michael Flynn.

2/ **Flynn stopped a military plan Turkey didn't like while being paid $500,000 as its lobbyist**. The decision came 10 days before Trump was sworn in as president. Obama’s national security team asked for Trump’s sign-off, since the plan would be executed after Trump had become president. Lawmakers are questioning whether Flynn acted on behalf of a foreign nation when making a military decision, with some going so far as to ask whether it constitutes treason. Flynn also failed to register as a foreign agent, which is a federal crime. ([McClatchy](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article151149647.html))

3/ **Flynn told the Trump team he was under investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey** weeks before he came to the White House. Trump made Flynn his national security adviser anyway, giving him access to nearly every secret held by American intelligence agencies.

4/ **Trump Tweets: Where was the special counsel for Hillary and Obama?** He then called the investigation into his campaign’s links with Russia “the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!” hours after issuing a more muted official statement in coordination with aides.

5/ **Sean Spicer is no longer expected to do a daily, on-camera briefing**, as Trump is frustrated with the way Spicer defends and explains his message. When Trump returns from his foreign trip, Sarah Huckabee Sanders will likely appear at the podium more with Spicer's public role being downsized.

6/ **NATO critic Stephen Miller is writing Trump's NATO speech**. Miller, an anti-globalist, has called the military alliance "incongruent with our current foreign policy challenges." ([BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnhudson/nato-skeptic-stephen-miller-is-writing-trumps-nato-speech))
