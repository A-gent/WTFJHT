\*\*\* UPDATES IN PROGRESS \*\*\*

1/ **The health care repeal vote is too close to call and Senate Republicans don't know what's in their plan, but they'll vote anyway on the motion to proceed**. About a half-dozen senators are publicly undecided about whether to start debate on rolling back the Affordable Care Act. Mitch McConnell needs 50 out of the 52 Senate Republicans to support him on the motion to proceed. Several senators have said they want a "replace" plan ready to go before voting "yes." An agreed upon replace plan is not in place.

If the procedural vote passes, it doesn't mean the bill will. Once debate starts, senators can then introduce amendments to the bill. The final version will still need to pass with 50 votes. The bill would then have to pass the House before making its way to Trump's desk. If the procedural vote fails, it doesn't mean the bill is dead, either. McConnell is forcing the vote to put every senator on record.

2/ **John McCain returned to the Senate for the health care vote** after being diagnosed with brain cancer last week. McCain's vote is critical to today's procedural vote. His absence would have left Senate Republicans with no margin of error.

3/ **Trump ripped Jeff Sessions on Twittering, calling him “very weak” when it comes to investigating Hillary Clinton.** Trump has repeatedly taken aim at Sessions in recent days, leading to speculation that it’s just a matter of time before the attorney general resigns or is fired. The recent tweets come a day after Trump publicly described Sessions as "beleaguered."

4/ **Trump has discussed replacing Jeff Sessions**. The move, viewed by some of Trump's advisors, is a strategy for firing special counsel Robert Mueller and ending his investigation into the campaign's efforts to coordinate with the Kremlin to influence the 2016 election. Sessions recently asked White House staff how he could patch up relations with Trump, but that went nowhere. Instead, Trump floated longtime ally Rudy Giuliani as a possible replacement for Sessions. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-leaves-sessions-twisting-in-the-wind-while-berating-him-publicly/2017/07/24/ce3bf142-708b-11e7-9eac-d56bd5568db8_story.html) / [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/966ae4f389064b2b90d84b03d260730e/AP-sources:-Trump-speaks-to-advisers-about-firing-Sessions))

5/ **Anthony Scaramucci says it's "probably" correct that Trump wants Sessions gone**. The new White House communications director didn't want to speak for the president, but said he thinks Trump has a "certain style" and he is "obviously frustrated." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/343586-scaramucci-says-its-probably-correct-trump-wants-sessions-gone))

6/ **Senate Republicans are not pleased with Trump's attacks on Sessions**. Senators have said that attacks Sessions, who spent 20 years in the Senate, strains Trump’s relationship with Senate Republicans. Many GOP senators have expressed annoyance with Trump's tweets, saying "I really have a hard time with this” and "I’d prefer that he didn’t do that. We’d like Jeff to be treated fairly." Senators have also been nonplussed by Trump’s criticism of Sessions’ decision to recuse himself, saying “Jeff made the right decision. It’s not only a legal decision, but it’s the right decision." ([McClatchy DC](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article163424468.html))

7/ **The Senate Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to Paul Manafort to testify in its Russia probe**. Manafort had agreed to provide notes of the meeting at Trump Tower last year with the Russian lawyer, according to a person close to the investigation. Committee chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Dianne Feinstein said they had been “unable to reach an agreement for a voluntary transcribed interview with the Judiciary Committee” with Manafort.

8/ **Parents are anger after Trump delivered a politicized speech to tens of thousands of boy scouts**. Over 35 minutes, Trump threatened to fire one of his Cabinet members, attacked Obama, dissed Hillary Clinton, marveled at the size of the crowd, warned the boys about the “fake media,” mocked the polls, and said more people would say “Merry Christmas." Responding to criticism, the Boy Scouts of America insisted it was "wholly non-partisan and does not promote any one position, product, service, political candidate or philosophy."

* **Trump joked he would fire Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price if the health care bill doesn't pass**. “Hopefully he’s going to get the votes tomorrow to start on the path to kill this thing called ObamaCare that’s really hurting us,” Trump said during a speech to Boy Scouts at the 2017 National Jamboree. "He better get them, otherwise I’ll say, ‘Tom, you’re fired.'" ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/343533-trump-jokes-about-firing-price-if-healthcare-legislation-doesnt-pass))
