\*\*\* UPDATES IN PROGRESS \*\*\*

1/ **Trump personally dictated Trump Jr.'s statement about his meeting with the Russian lawyer**, saying they had “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children” when they met in June 2016. Trump Jr. ultimately acknowledged that he met with the Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer after receiving an email [promising damaging information about Hillary Clinton](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/10/Day-172/#1-donald-trump-jr-met-with-a-kremlin). Trump's advisers fear his direct involvement leaves him needlessly vulnerable to potential obstruction of justice and could place members of his inner circle in legal jeopardy.

2/ **Senate Republicans intend to move on from health care**, despite Trump's  continued pressure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have signaled that they were looking for other victories, as 50 votes for rolling back health care appears unlikely.

3/ **A GOP House member called on Mueller to resign**, saying he has a “conflict of interest” since Comey was the deputy attorney general in 2003 when he served as the FBI director. Trent Franks is attempting to cast Mueller and Comey as “longtime allies." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/344711-gop-house-member-calls-on-mueller-to-resign))

4/ **Multiple White House officials were tricked by an email prankster** masquerading as Jared Kushner, Reince Priebus, and Eric Trump. The UK prankster fooled Anthony Scaramucci, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert, and others into responding. In Bossert's case, he revealed his personal email address. Real Scaramucci responded to Fake Priebus: "You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize."

poll/ **60% of voters believe the White House is in chaos, compared with 33% who say it is running well**. 29% believe Trump's staff serves him well, compared with 39% who say his staff doesn't serve him well. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/31/white-house-chaos-poll-241180))
