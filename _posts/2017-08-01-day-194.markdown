1/ **Trump personally dictated Trump Jr.'s statement about his meeting with the Russian lawyer**, saying they had “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children” when they met in June 2016. Trump Jr. ultimately acknowledged that he met with the Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer after receiving an email [promising damaging information about Hillary Clinton](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/10/Day-172/#1-donald-trump-jr-met-with-a-kremlin). Trump's advisers fear his direct involvement leaves him needlessly vulnerable to potential obstruction of justice and could place members of his inner circle in legal jeopardy.

2/ **Senate Republicans intend to move on from health care**, despite Trump's  continued pressure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have signaled that they were looking for other victories, as 50 votes for rolling back health care appears unlikely.

* **Ryan Zinke said it's “laughable” to suggest he threatened Alaska’s senators over the health care vote**. Zinke had [threatened retribution](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/27/day-189/#5-the-trump-administration-threatene) against Alaska over Lisa Murkowski's no vote on health care.

3/ **A GOP House member called on Mueller to resign**, saying he has a “conflict of interest” since Comey was the deputy attorney general in 2003 when he served as the FBI director. Trent Franks is attempting to cast Mueller and Comey as “longtime allies." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/344711-gop-house-member-calls-on-mueller-to-resign))

4/ **Multiple White House officials were tricked by an email prankster** masquerading as Jared Kushner, Reince Priebus, and Eric Trump. The UK prankster fooled Anthony Scaramucci, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert, and others into responding. In Bossert's case, he revealed his personal email address. Real Scaramucci responded to Fake Priebus: "You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize."

5/ **Jared Kushner told congressional interns that Trump’s election team was too disorganized to collude with Russia**. “They thought we colluded, but we couldn’t even collude with our local offices,” Kushner said, adding: “I’m a lot more comfortable talking to you guys today ’cause there isn’t any press."

6/ **Fox News and a Trump donor created a fake news story to deflect attention from the administration's ties to Russia**, a lawsuit alleges. The story is about the death of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, which first aired in May, but was retracted a week later. The lawsuit, filed by Rod Wheeler, a paid commentator for the news network, claims a Fox News reporter created quotations out of thin air and attributed them to him in order to propel the story. A month before the story ran, Trump donor Ed Butowsky and Wheeler met at the White House with Sean Spicer to brief him on what they were uncovering. At a press gaggle after the story ran, Spicer claimed to have no knowledge of the Rich story. Spicer now confirms meeting with the two.

7/ **A former Fox News executive who helped Roger Ailes cover up sexual harassment could be joining Trump’s communications team**. Bill Shine has been named in lawsuits that accused him of abetting Ailes’s harassing behavior toward women. The former co-president of Fox News and top lieutenant to Ailes has denied knowing that Ailes had sexually harassed employees.

poll/ **60% of voters believe the White House is in chaos, compared with 33% who say it is running well**. 29% believe Trump's staff serves him well, compared with 39% who say his staff doesn't serve him well. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/31/white-house-chaos-poll-241180))
