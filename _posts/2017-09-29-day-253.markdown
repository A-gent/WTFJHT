1/ **Trump could personally save about $1.1 billion in taxes under his proposed plan**. The analysis is based on Trump’s 2005 federal tax return and his [estimated](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/) $2.86 billion net worth. In theory, Trump could save about $1.1 billion from repealing the estate tax, $31 million from repealing the alternative minimum tax, about $16 million from changes to certain types of business income, and about $500k from reducing the highest tax rate from 39.6% to 35%.

2/ **Trump's top economic adviser suggested that a family of four earning $100,000 can expect to save $1,000 a year in taxes** – enough to "renovate their kitchen. They can buy a new car. They can take a family vacation. They can increase their lifestyle.” [Yesterday](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/09/28/day-252/#1-trumps-top-economic-adviser-cant-g), Gary Cohn said he "can't guarantee" taxes won't go up for the middle class" and “the wealthy are not getting a tax cut" under Trump’s tax plan. Cohn is worth an estimated $266 million. ([HuffPost](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gary-cohn-trump-tax-plan-new-car_us_59cd50e3e4b0ef0694274690))

3/ **Senate Republicans released their budget blueprint, paving the way for tax reform without Democratic support**. The 89-page plan sets up the use of budget reconciliation to advance the legislation with 50 votes in the Senate, rather than the usual 60-vote supermajority. Under the proposal, Republicans can add up to $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, giving lawmakers the ability to lower rates for businesses and individuals. Republicans believe they will offset that lost revenue with increased economic growth prompted by the tax cuts. Trump described the blueprint as a "giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut."

4/ **The acting Homeland Security Secretary called Puerto Rico's recovery "really a good news story."** San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz shot back: "Dammit, this is not a good news story. This is a 'people are dying' story. It's a life-or-death story." [Early this week](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/09/26/day-250/#8-trump-will-travel-to-puerto-rico-n), Trump placed some blame on Puerto Rico for its situation, tweeting that the US territory had "broken infrastructure & massive debt." Today, he tweeted that "big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding!"

5/ **The Justice Department wants Facebook to turn over information about people who "liked" an anti-Trump Facebook page**.

Information from the three accounts that could provide the personal details of thousands of activists who expressed interest in anti-Trump rallies. The DOJ originally requested [that 1.3 million IP addresses](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/15/day-208/#8-the-justice-department-has-demande) from disruptj20.org be turned over, which a DC judge ruled the web hosting company was [obligated to turn over](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/24/day-217/#9-a-web-hosting-company-was-ordered).

Earlier this month, the Department of Justice notified the company supplying services for RT America that it is obligated to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act due to the work it does for RT. Federal investigators are also looking into whether RT and Sputnik were part of Russia's influence campaign in the 2016 election.
