1/ **House leaders are split on whether a Russian inquiry is needed**. The top Republican and Democrat on the Intelligence Committee gave sharply conflicting views of their investigation into Russian efforts to influence the election, raising questions about whether they will be able to work together. Republican Devin Nunes said that there was no evidence anyone from the Trump campaign had communicated with the government in Moscow. Democrat Adam Schiff said that it was too early to rule out the ties, because the panel had not yet been provided with any evidence collected by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

* **GOP intelligence chairman David Nunes: “There’s no evidence of anything” regarding Russia-Trump campaign contacts**. Nunes said the House Intelligence Committee won't subpoena Trump's tax returns and decries “McCarthyism” and “witch hunts” based on reports that Americans may have connections to the Russian regime.

* **George W. Bush said ‘‘we all need answers’’ on the extent of contact between Trump’s team and the Russian government**. He didn’t rule out the idea that a special prosecutor could be necessary to lead an investigation.

2/ **Trump goes to Congress to make a sale**. Trump is under pressure to show that his White House can be effective in delivering on the sweeping changes he has promised by working with allies on Capitol Hill. Trump's aides are promising an "optimistic" speech designed to rally Americans toward a hopeful future. Trump will address Congress shortly after 9 p.m EST tonight. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/28/politics/donald-trump-congress-speech/)

* **A guide for Trump's first speech to Congress**. Instead of reflecting on the state of the U.S., like a State of the Union address, the first joint session speech is typically used to outline a new president’s goals for his administration. Trump will do exactly that — and try to downplay the chaos that has plagued his first 40 days in office. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trumps-first-speech-to-congress-235478)
* **Trump prepares to address a divided audience: The Republican Congress**. On health care, tax reform and federal spending, GOP lawmakers hold differences of opinion within their own party that are obstructing passage of ambitious Republican policies, and so far Trump has shown little desire to openly referee those disputes. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trump-prepares-to-address-a-divided-audience-the-republican-congress/2017/02/28/183138ce-fced-11e6-8ebe-6e0dbe4f2bca_story.html)

3/ **Trump gave himself an A grade for his presidency, but only a C for communicating. how. great. he. has. been.** in a "Fox and Friends" interview today. He also blamed Obama for organizing opposition against him, called the House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi “incompetent,” and criticized his own press secretary for how he has handled leaks. He has called “Fox and Friends” one of his favorite shows. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/politics/trump-address-joint-session-congress.html)

* **Trump gave himself a "C or C+" grade for communicating with the public: Needs improvement**. He offered high marks for his accomplishments, but he gave himself a “C” for messaging, conceding that he has not been able to properly explain what he's done. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/28/trump-grades-himself-on-communicating-with-the-public-needs-improvement/)

4/ **Trump says Obama is helping organize protests against his presidency**. Trump has been dismissing the protests against his presidency and demonstrations at congressional town hall meetings across the country as concocted by his political enemies. "I think that President Obama is behind it because his people certainly are behind it," Trump said. "In terms of him being behind things, that's politics. It will probably continue.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/27/trump-says-obama-is-helping-to-organize-protests-against-his-presidency/)

5/ **Trump begins E.P.A. rollback with executive order on clean water rules**. The order, which will have almost no immediate legal effect and could take longer than a single presidential term to dismantle, directs E.P.A. chief Scott Pruitt to rewrite the 2015 rule known as the Waters of the United States. The rule gives the federal government broad authority to limit pollution in major bodies of water as well as in streams and wetlands that drain into them. 

Trump is also expected to sign a similar order instructing Pruitt to begin the process of withdrawing and revising Obama’s 2015 climate-change regulation, aimed at curbing emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants. In his former job as attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt led or took part in 14 lawsuits intended to block the E.P.A.’s major regulations, including the clean water and climate rules that he is now charged with dismantling. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/politics/trump-epa-clean-water-climate-change.html)

* **Trump to direct rollback of Obama-era water rule**. Trump will instruct the E.P.A. and Army Corps of Engineers to “review and reconsider” a 2015 rule known as the Waters of the United States rule. The move that could ultimately make it easier for agricultural and development interests to drain wetlands and small streams. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/27/trump-to-direct-rollback-of-obama-era-water-rule-tuesday/)

6/ **E.P.A. braces for a possibly “devastating" 25% budget cut.** There is widespread concern within the E.P.A. that the changes will dramatically alter the function of an agency that was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970, and will weaken the agency to the point where it can only do its most basic functions. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/epa-cuts-25-percent/index.html)

* **The Pentagon budget next year sounds huge at first, but…** it comes with a significant cut in foreign aid, including programs that military officials say contribute to global stability and are seen as important in helping avoid future conflicts. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/us/politics/trump-foreign-military-spending-cuts-criticism.html)
* **Trump says “revved up economy" will pay for budget proposals**. The extra $54 billion dollars he has proposed spending on the U.S. military will be offset by a stronger economy as well as cuts in other areas, he said. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-spending-idUSKBN16718E)

7/ **Trump urges insurers to work together to "save Americans from Obamacare.”** Trump met with major health insurers in the midst of political divisions over how to dismantle and replace Obama's signature health-care law and intensifying public pressure to preserve the policy. He criticized the Affordable Care Act for creating minimal health coverage requirements that restricted the types of plans insurers could sell. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/02/27/trump-urges-insurers-to-work-together-to-save-americans-from-obamacare/)

* **Schumer predicts health-care law "will not be repealed.”** Schumer pointed to widespread disagreement among Republicans about how to go about undoing key parts of the law, as well as intense pressure from constituents urging them not to rush ahead with their effort. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/27/amid-gop-discord-schumer-predicts-health-care-law-will-not-be-repealed/)

8/ **Trump’s silence on deadly Olathe shooting is disquieting**. Nearly a week has passed since two India-born engineers were singled out and shot at an Olathe bar, presumably because they were immigrants, darker in skin tone and possibly viewed by the shooter as unwanted foreigners. ([Kansas City Star](http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article135323049.html)

9/ **New NSC chief pushed Trump to moderate his language on terrorism**, urging him to stop using the phrase "radical Islamic terrorism.” The phrase, however, will be in Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress tonight  — even though McMaster reviewed drafts and his staff pressed the president's speechwriter not to use it. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/mcmaster-trump-terrorism-speech-235476)
