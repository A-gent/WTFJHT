1/ **Trump's secretaries of state and defense are trying to convince him not to conduct a "bloody nose" attack against North Korea**.

([Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/tillerson-mattis-trump-north-korea-strike-2018-1))

2/ **Robert Mueller could interview Trump in the next few weeks on a limited set of questions**. Mueller told Trump's lawyers in late December that he'd likely request an interview with Trump. A person familiar with the discussions said Mueller is most interested in whether Trump tried to obstruct justice. ([The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-indicates-he-will-likely-seek-interview-with-trump/2018/01/08/86100bb2-f473-11e7-beb6-c8d48830c54d_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/politics/mueller-trump-interview-russia-investigation.html))

3/ **White House officials believe that Trump will be "sunk" if Robert Mueller looks into Trump's finances** as part of the Russia probe. "People don't think in the White House — don't think that he colluded with Russia," Michael Wolff said, author of *[Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Fury-Inside-Trump-White/dp/1250158060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&linkCode=ll1&tag=wtfjht-20&linkId=3b44d37dec9d33a86fd15d75969b7381)*. "They do think that if the investigation goes near his finances, he's sunk."

4/ **The Russian lawyer met Ivanka Trump after the Trump Tower meeting** with Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner in June 2016.

5/ **Trump renominated two judicial nominees that the American Bar Association rated as "not qualified" to serve**. The ABA said one was unqualified for a lifetime seat on the bench due to his "work habits," while the other wasn't qualified due to her lack of trial court experience. In total, Trump resubmitted 21 judicial nominees to the Senate after their nominations expired in 2017.
