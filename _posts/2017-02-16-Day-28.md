1/ **Spies keep sensitive intelligence from Trump, underscoring deep mistrust**.

3/ **White House plans to have a Trump ally review intelligence agencies**. Trump’s plan to assign a New York billionaire to lead a broad review of American intelligence agencies has members of the intelligence community fearing it could curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the president’s worldview.

* **Trump’s professed love for leaks has quickly faded**.

4/ **The Kremlin ordered state media to cut way back on their fawning coverage of Trump**, reflecting a growing concern among senior Russian officials that the new U.S. administration will be less friendly than first thought. In January, Trump received more mentions in the media than Putin, relegating the Russian leader to the No. 2 spot for the first time since he returned to the Kremlin in 2012 after four years as premier.

* **GOP senators unnerved by Trump-Russia relationship**. While Republicans aren’t yet willing to endorse a special investigative committee, GOP senators have indicated that could change.

Demonstrators also planned a march to the White House. ([USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/16/a-day-without-immigrants-strike/97965460/){:target="_blank"}) 

6/ **ICE detains woman seeking domestic abuse protection at Texas courthouse**. A hearing in El Paso County in Texas went from ordinary to “unprecedented” last week when half a dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up at a courthouse where an undocumented woman was seeking a protective order against the boyfriend she accused of abusing her. She left under arrest. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/16/this-is-really-unprecedented-ice-detains-woman-seeking-domestic-abuse-protection-at-texas-courthouse/){:target="_blank"}) 

7/ **Leaked emails show Justice Clarence Thomas’s wife pushing travel ban**. In an email sent to a conservative listserv, Ginni Thomas asked for advice on how to organize in favor of Trump’s travel ban. But by doing so, she may have inadvertently made it harder for the executive order to survive the Supreme Court.

9/ **The Endangered Species Act may be heading for the threatened list**. A Senate hearing to “modernize the Endangered Species Act” unfolded just as supporters of the law had feared, with round after round of criticism from Republican lawmakers who said the federal effort to keep species from going extinct encroaches on states’ rights, is unfair to landowners and stymies efforts by mining companies to extract resources and create jobs. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/15/the-endangered-species-act-may-be-heading-for-the-threatened-list-this-hearing-confirmed-it/){:target="_blank"}) 

10/ **More than 200 Republicans in Congress are skipping February town halls with constituents**. After outpourings of rage at some early town halls, many Republicans are opting for more controlled Facebook Live or “tele-town halls,” where questions can be screened by press secretaries and followups are limited.
