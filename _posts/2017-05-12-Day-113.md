1/ **Tweet: Trump threatens to cancel all future press briefings for the "sake of accuracy."** And, because it is "not possible" to always tell the truth. While the White House can't get its story straight about the firing of FBI director James Comey, Trump has offered his solution: cancel all press briefings. ([CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/12/media/trump-press-briefings/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/us/politics/trump-threatens-retaliation-against-comey-warns-he-may-cancel-press-briefings.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/12/trump-threatens-to-cancel-white-house-briefings-because-it-is-not-possible-to-always-tell-the-truth/))

2/ **Tweet: Trump warns Comey against leaking to the press, suggesting there are "tapes" of their private conversations**. It's unclear if any tapes exist, however. Regardless, Comey is "not worried about any tapes," a CNN source said, adding that "if there is a tape, there's nothing [Comey] is worried about" that could be on it. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/12/trump-suggests-there-may-be-tapes-of-his-private-conversations-with-former-fbi-director/) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/12/donald-trump-james-comey-tapes-238309) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/12/politics/james-comey-dinner-trump/))

3/ **Comey's reportedly furious by the lack of respect the White House showed him**. Trump called Comey a "showboat" and "a grandstander," and even suggested he was not "competent." ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/US/comey-furious-lack-respect-white-house-showed-sources/story?id=47367073))

4/ **Trump asked for Comey to pledge his loyalty at a private dinner seven days after the inauguration**. Comey declined to make the pledge, but instead told Trump that he would always give him "honesty." Trump pressed him on whether it would be "honest loyalty." Comey agreed. Trump claims Comey assured him "three times" that he was not under FBI investigation.

5/ **Trump shifts his reason for firing Comey to "this Russia thing" being a "made-up story."** He labeled it "an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/trump-comey-showboat-fbi.html))

6/ **Jeff Sessions directed prosecutors to seek the toughest drug charges**. The new sentencing guidelines roll back an Obama-era policy of avoiding charging nonviolent, less-serious drug offenders with long, mandatory-minimum sentences, and instead revives a Bush-era policy that tasked federal prosecutors with charging "the most serious readily provable offense." ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/attorney-general-sessions-revives-policy-of-tougher-sentences-for-drug-offenders-1494583202) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-issues-sweeping-new-criminal-charging-policy/2017/05/11/4752bd42-3697-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/12/politics/sessions-criminal-charging-memo/index.html))

7/ **The EPA may allow a massive gold and copper mine at the headwaters of one of Alaska’s salmon fisheries**. The Trump administration will allow a Canadian-owned company to seek a federal permit to build a mine near Bristol Bay. In 2014, the EPA released a study that concluded large-scale mining in the bay posed significant risk to salmon and could adversely affect Alaska Natives in the region. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/47609e10bc3f473eb33b2302024ed1f4/EPA-may-allow-massive-mine-near-pristine-Alaskan-bay))

8/ **Lawyers said that a review of Trump's last 10 years of tax returns don't show "any income of any type from Russian sources."** Except for some income from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant that was held in Moscow as well as a property sold to a Russian billionaire in 2008 for $95 million. The attorneys did not release copies of Trump’s tax returns.
