1/ **Trump called Kim Jong Un a "madman with nuclear weapons,"** days before stating publicly that he would be "honored" to meet with Kim. In an April 29 call with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, Trump asked for his input on whether Kim is "stable or not stable." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-calls-kim-jong-un-a-madman-with-nuclear-weapons-according-to-transcript-of-duterte-call/2017/05/23/211d1474-3fe8-11e7-9869-bac8b446820a_story.html))

2/ **The US has two nuclear submarines off the coast of North Korea**, Trump told Duterte during last month's call. Trump revealed that “we have a lot of firepower over there. We have two submarines — the best in the world. We have two nuclear submarines, not that we want to use them at all." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/us/politics/trump-duterte-phone-transcript-philippine-drug-crackdown.html))

3/ **Trump congratulated Duterte for doing an "unbelievable job" in his war on drugs**, where the government has allowed extrajudicial killing for drug dealers and users. "You are a good man," Trump told Duterte. "Keep up the good work." The State Department’s human rights report calls the Philippines "disregard for human rights and due process" one of the "most significant human rights problems."

4/ **Pope Francis urged Trump to meet US commitments on climate change**. He gave Trump copy of his 2015 encyclical (a type of papal document used for significant or important issues) calling for urgent, drastic cuts in fossil-fuel emissions. Trump's called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.

5/ **The House Intelligence Committee will subpoena Michael Flynn** after he declined to appear before the panel. Flynn already rejected requests from the Senate Intelligence Committee for a list of his contacts with Russian officials, invoking his Fifth Amendments rights against self-incrimination. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-idUSKBN18K1ZC) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/1f0c8acee5264f6497e968973b3d07e9/House-intel-panel-to-issue-subpoenas-for-Flynn-material) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/24/house-intelligence-committee-to-subpoena-flynn-238763))

* **Flynn hit with two Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenas** and risks being held in contempt of Congress if he does not comply with the requests. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michael-flynn-risks-held-contempt-congress-senate-intelligence/story?id=47594971)

6/ **Trump lawyers up and retains Marc Kasowitz for the Russia investigation**. Related, Trump is "very close" to choosing an FBI director. Former Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman was his top choice until the administration hit reset today, wanting to see a broader list of candidates. Lieberman joined Kasowitz' law firm in 2013.

7/ **Democrats flipped seats in two districts that voted for Trump**. The new legislature seats in New York and New Hampshire won't change the balance of power, but may signal a change in the country's political climate.
