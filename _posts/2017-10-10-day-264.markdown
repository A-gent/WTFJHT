1/ **Trump plans to go around Congress to provide new insurance options for Americans**. The White House is finalizing an executive order, which Trump is expected to sign this week, that would expand health care plans offered by associations and allow individuals to pool together to buy insurance outside their states. “Since Congress can’t get its act together on HealthCare, I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people – FAST,” Trump tweeted. By banding together to buy coverage, associations could join the large group insurance market, which is [exempt from the ACA’s requirement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2017/10/10/the-health-202-trump-has-a-backdoor-way-to-lift-obamacare-regulations/59db9b4630fb0468cea81e13/) that plans cover essential health benefits.

2/ **The White House blamed Bob Corker for the Twitter tiff with Trump**. On Sunday morning, Trump tweeted that Corker “didn’t have the guts” to run for re-election. Corker replied that it's "a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.” Kellyanne Conway called Corker's tweet "incredibly irresponsible" with Pence defending Trump against what he called "empty rhetoric and baseless attacks." 

In an [interview with the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/us/politics/bob-corker-trump-interview-transcript.html), Corker said that Trump is acting "like he's doing 'The Apprentice'" and that he could set the nation "on the path to World War III." As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Corker could block the confirmation of a new secretary of state if Trump pushed out Rex Tillerson and would play a key role on whether to "[decertify](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/05/day-259/#7-trump-will-“decertify”-the-interna)" the Iran nuclear deal.

3/ **Trump gave Bob Corker a nickname as their feud escalates**. "The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation," Trump tweeted. "Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!" The [transcript of the conversation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/us/politics/bob-corker-trump-interview-transcript.html) has Corker saying "I understand we're on the record. I don't like normally talking to you on the record -- I'm kidding you -- but I will." Labeling Corker "liddle" is a reference to the 2016 campaign, when he called Marco Rubio little. "Let me start with Little Marco. He just looked like Little Marco to me. And it's not Little. It's Liddle. L-I-D-D-L-E." The New York Times reporter [disputed Trump's claim](http://thehill.com/homenews/media/354669-nyt-reporter-fires-back-at-trump-corker-recorded-interview-too) that Corker was recorded without his knowledge, tweeting that "Corker had 2 aides on line, also recording, and they made sure after it ended that I was taping, too."

4/ **Trump challenged Tillerson to an IQ test after the secretary of state's "moron" comment**. "I think it's fake news," Trump said, "but if he did that, I guess we'll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win." Tillerson [reportedly](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/04/day-258/#1-rex-tillerson-reportedly-called-tr) called Trump a "fucking moron" and nearly resigned this summer. ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/donald-trump/exclusive-interview/#3de4d789bdec) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/10/10/trump-proposes-iq-tests-face-off-with-tillerson-after-secretary-of-state-calls-him-a-moron/))

5/ **Scott Pruitt wants to eliminate the federal tax credits for the wind and solar power industries**, saying the credits prevent utility companies from making the best decisions about power generation. “I’d let them stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sources," the EPA chief said.  ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/354594-epa-chief-id-do-away-with-wind-solar-tax-credits) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-09/epa-chief-calls-for-ending-wind-tax-credits-to-help-coal-survive))

6/ **Trump has made 1,318 false or misleading claims over the past 263 days**. He has averaged five claims a day, even picking up pace since the six-month mark. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/10/10/president-trump-has-made-1318-false-or-misleading-claims-over-263-days/))

poll/ **Trump's approval rating has fallen in every state since he took office**. A majority of voters in 25 states and the District of Columbia said they disapproved of Trump's job performance, including 55% in Michigan, 53% in Wisconsin and Iowa, and 51% in Pennsylvania. The share of Republicans who strongly approve of Trump has declined from 53% to 43% since January. 71% of Democrats strongly disapproved of Trump.
