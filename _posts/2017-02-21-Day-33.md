1/ **Homeland Security unveils a sweeping plan to deport undocumented immigrants**. The memos instruct all agents, including Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to identify, capture, and quickly deport every undocumented immigrant they encounter. The vast majority of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants are at risk of deportation.

* **New Trump deportation rules make it easier to deport people immediately**. Under the Obama administration, expedited removal was used only within 100 miles of the border for people who had been in the country no more than 14 days. Now it will include those who have been in the country for up to two years, and located anywhere in the nation.

2/ **Trump: Anti-Semitism "has to stop”**. Trump denounced anti-Semitism after coming under pressure to address an uptick in incidents targeting Jewish institutions across the U.S. Trump has insisted he has spoken out against anti-Semitism “whenever I get a chance,” even though he has refused to confront the issue directly on multiple occasions.

* **Up to 200 headstones damaged at Jewish cemetery**. The incident comes on the same day several Jewish community centers around the country received bomb threats. The regional director of the Anti-Defamation League said she didn’t know if the headstones had been damaged as an act of hatred but questioned motives that would lead to the act.

* **A brief history of Donald Trump addressing questions about racism and anti-Semitism**. Since the beginning of his campaign, Trump has been repeatedly asked for his thoughts on racial or religious harassment. Many observers have felt his responses left something to be desired.

3/ **Trump has insisted that he had no contact with Russia during the campaign. Russia says otherwise**.

* **Chuck Schumer: Jeff Sessions must recuse himself from the Flynn investigation**. The gravity of Flynn’s contact with the Russians and the reports that he may have lied to the FBI cannot be overstated or ignored.

4/ **Bannon told Germany that the EU is flawed** a week before Pence pledged America's "steadfast and enduring" commitment to the European Union. The encounter unsettled people in the German government, in part because some officials had been holding out hope that Bannon might temper his views once in government and offer a more nuanced message on Europe in private. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-trump-idUSKBN1601DS){:target="_blank"})

5/ **The Trump White House is already cooking the books**. The Trump transition team ordered the Council of Economic Advisers to predict sustained economic growth of 3 to 3.5%. The staffers were then directed to backfill all the other numbers in their models to produce these growth rates.

7/ **Trump’s nominees gripe that the White House isn’t protecting them**. Candidates for top jobs in Trump’s administration are getting spooked after Andrew Puzder’s torpedoed nomination, and they fear the White House isn't doing enough to protect them from grueling confirmations, according to several sources involved in the process.
