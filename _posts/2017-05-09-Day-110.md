1/ **James Comey’s testimony regarding Huma Abedin forwarding thousands of emails was inaccurate**. The FBI hasn’t decided how to correct the director’s false claim. Abedin forwarded a handful of Clinton emails to her husband for printing — not the “hundreds and thousands” cited by Comey. ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/comeys-testimony-on-huma-abedin-forwarding-emails-was-inaccurate))

* **Comey overstated key findings involving the Hillary Clinton email investigation during testimony to Congress last week**. None of the forwarded emails were marked classified, but a small number contained information that was later judged to contain classified information. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/comey-misstated-key-clinton-email-evidence-at-hearing-say-people-close-to-investigation/2017/05/09/074c1c7e-34bd-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html))

2/ **Trump pointed the finger at Obama for failing to vet Flynn**. At the time Flynn was fired, he had an interim clearance in order to allow him to do his job while he waited for his CIA clearance. The concerns about Flynn came after US intelligence realized he was discussing sanctions with the Russians and then misleading US officials about the nature of his conversations. He didn't disclose his payment from RT to government officials until after he was fired by Trump. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/05/09/trumps-pointing-of-the-finger-at-obama-for-failing-to-vet-flynn/))

* **Sean Spicer weighed in, suggesting that Obama's advice was taken with a grain of salt** because Flynn "was an outspoken critic of President Obama's shortcomings." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/08/why-did-trump-ignore-obama-and-sally-yates-about-michael-flynn-because-they-were-losers-apparently/))
* **Obama warned then-President-elect Trump in November against hiring Michael Flynn as his national security adviser**. ([WTF Just Happened Today: Day 109](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/05/08/Day-109/#1-obama-warned-then-president-elect))
* **How the White House explained waiting 18 days to fire Flynn**. Here are the various explanations he and other administration officials have given in the past. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/michael-flynn-russia.html))

3/ **The US is poised to expand military efforts against the Taliban in Afghanistan**. Trump’s most senior military and foreign policy advisers have proposed a major shift in strategy in Afghanistan that would effectively put the United States back on a war footing with the Taliban. The plan would add at least 3,000 troops to the existing force of about 8,400. The US force would also be bolstered by requests for matching troops from NATO nations. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-poised-to-expand-military-effort-against-taliban-in-afghanistan/2017/05/08/356c4930-33fa-11e7-b412-62beef8121f7_story.html))

* **The US weighs sending as many as 5,000 more troops to Afghanistan**. Trump, however, is still deciding on a variety of options being presented to him by military leaders. The current force in Afghanistan is about 8,400. ([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-weighs-sending-many-5-000-more-troops-afghanistan-n756751))

4/ **White House advisers postponed their meeting to decide US participation in the Paris Climate Agreement**. Trump's key advisers are divided over whether he should keep his campaign promise to pull the United States out of the Paris agreement, which won the backing of 195 nations in 2015. Trump is expected to make a final decision on whether to withdraw sometime this month.

5/ **An Iowa congressman abruptly ended a TV interview and then walked into an angry town hall meeting**. He was unhappy with questions about who would be allowed into the series of town hall events he is holding this week in his district. A few hours later, he showed up at his town hall meeting where most of the prescreened audience screamed at him because of his vote on the House Obamacare repeal bill. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/09/rod-blum-walks-out-of-interview-238145) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/05/08/iowa-congressman-walks-out-of-a-tv-interview-and-into-an-angry-town-hall-meeting/))

6/ **The Trump administration cited a segregation-era ruling to defend its travel ban**. In 1971, the Supreme Court decided that courts shouldn’t investigate the motivations of officials who closed public pools in Jackson, Mississippi, rather than integrate them. ([HuffPost](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-travel-ban-cites-segregation-ruling_us_5910da0ee4b0e7021e9a5cda))

7/ **Trump Photoshopped a tweet denying collusion with Russia into his Twitter header**. During Senate testimony yesterday, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he was not aware of any evidence that proves there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump has since changed his Twitter header to a picture without the Photoshopped tweet. ([New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/trump-puts-russia-collusion-denial-in-his-twitter-header.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/09/trump-mocked-for-adding-one-of-his-own-tweets-to-twitter-banner))

8/ **Mitch McConnell stacks the Senate Republican working group on health care with 13 conservative men – but no women**. The working group includes the party’s top leaders, as well as three committee chairmen and two of the most conservative senators, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/us/politics/women-health-care-senate.html) / [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-women-health-care-overhaul-20170509-story.html))

9/ **Trump's review of Dodd-Frank will not be completed by early June as originally targeted**. Instead, officials will report findings piece-by-piece, with priority given to banking regulations. In February, Trump ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to review the law and report back within 120 days, saying his administration expected to be cutting large parts of it. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wall-street-trump-idUSKBN1842DW))

10/ **Republicans are struggling to recruit Senate challengers in states where Trump won**. In Wisconsin and Michigan, Republicans have passed on challenging Democrats due to Trump's approval ratings.
