Republican leaders are faced with two choices: craft a bill that can get 50 votes, or bring up a bill they know will fail in order to end the health care debate and move on to tax reform, demonstrating that Republicans are too divided. They're prepared to take a failed vote on the Obamacare repeal in order to "show them a body" and bring the seven-year quest to a definitive end.

10/ **Trump will live-tweet during Comey's testimony on Thursday**. He "wants to be the messenger, his own warrior, his own lawyer, his own spokesman" and as such will directly respond to Comey on Twitter as the testimony is underway.

I'll delete if that turns out to be the case.]_ ([Raw Story](http://www.rawstory.com/2017/06/trump-will-live-tweet-during-testimony-of-former-fbi-director-james-comey-report/))
