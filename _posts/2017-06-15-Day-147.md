1/ **Trump tweets: The reports of my "phony collusion with the Russians" have been greatly exaggerated**. Trump's twitter tirade this morning essentially confirms yesterday's news that special counsel Robert Mueller is [now investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/06/14/Day-146/#1-robert-mueller is-now-investigatin). Nevertheless, Trump persisted: "You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history". ([CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tweets-obstruction-of-justice-reports-are-phony/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/us/politics/trump-obstruction-of-justice-reports.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/06/15/on-twitter-trump-decries-obstruction-probe-related-to-phony-story/) / [New York Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/dismissive-tweet-trump-confirm-obstruction-probe-article-1.3249477))

* **The three prongs of Mueller's Russia investigation explained**. Mueller is investigating Russian meddling in the election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign, attempts to obstruct justice, and any possible financial crimes. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/15/3-prongs-of-the-russia-investigation-explained/))
* **Mueller is examining whether Trump obstructed justice**. The special counsel investigation has expanded to look into president's firing of former FBI Director James Comey. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mueller-probe-examining-whether-donald-trump-obstructed-justice-1497490897))

2/ **Aides blame Trump for the obstruction of justice probe: "The president did this to himself"** and "shot himself in the foot again with this cockamamie scheme to get Mueller to play ball" by spreading rumors that Trump might fire the special counsel. Senators, White House aides, former prosecutors, and FBI veterans are urging Trump not to do it, as firing Mueller now would require him to personally direct the Department of Justice to do so, which "could be shown that his purpose was to impede the investigation" and "could be additional evidence of obstruction of justice."

3/ **Trump revised his travel ban to address arguments that it would expire today**. Under the ban's original wording, it would last "for 90 days from the effective date of this order." An seperate provision set the effective date as March 16, meaning the ban would have expired June 14. The administration is arguing that the court orders blocking the ban had implicitly delayed the effective date.

4/ **A GOP congressman wants members of Congress to "curtail" their town halls after the Scalise shooting** "until we agree that we need to be more civil." In addition to yesterday's shooting, Lou Barletta cited "those town halls where the police had to carry people out" as a safety concern and reason to cut back on hosting town hall forums. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/15/politics/kfile-lou-barletta-town-halls/))

5/ **Dennis Rodman gave Kim Jong Un a copy of Trump's book "The Art of the Deal."** Rodman may be the only person in the world who has personal relationships with both Trump and the North Korean supreme leader. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/06/15/dennis-rodman-just-gave-kim-jong-un-the-art-of-the-deal-and-it-may-be-a-genius-move/) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/15/asia/dennis-rodman-north-korea/index.html))

poll/ **50% of the CEOs, business leaders, government officials and academics gave Trump an "F" for his first 130 days in office**. 21% gave Trump's performance a "D" and just 1% gave him an "A." ([CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/15/investing/ceos-give-trump-f-yale-survey/index.html))
