1/ **John McCain condemned Trump's "America First" policy as "half-baked, spurious nationalism"** and charged that Trump would "rather find scapegoats than solve problems." McCain's remarks came as he was honored with the Liberty Medal by the National Constitution Center. While he didn't refer to Trump or his administration by name, McCain added that it's unpatriotic to "abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe" and to "refuse the obligations of international leadership."

2/ **Trump warned McCain "to be careful because at some point I fight back,"** adding that "I’m being very, very nice but at some point I fight back and it won’t be pretty." McCain’s response: "I have faced tougher adversaries." ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/cd337697c2f04726b69076627c014eb7/Trump-issues-warning-to-McCain-after-senator's-tough-speech))

3/ **Trump falsely claimed that Obama didn't call the families of troops killed in duty**. "If you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn’t make calls," Trump said in response to a question about why he had not publicly acknowledged the four Green Berets killed in an ambush in Niger two weeks ago. "A lot of them didn’t make calls. I like to call when it’s appropriate."

Obama’s former aides were quick to respond: Eric Holder tweeted that Trump needs to "Stop the damn lying - you’re the President." And, Benjamin Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser, called Trump's claim an "outrageous and disrespectful lie even by Trump standards." Trump offered no evidence to back up his claim.

4/ **Trump told reporters to ask John Kelly if Obama called him after his son died in Afghanistan**. "As far as other presidents," Trump said, "I don't know, you could ask Gen. Kelly, did he get a call from Obama? I don't know what Obama's policy was." He added that "I really speak for myself. I am not speaking for other people. I don't know what (George W.) Bush did. I don't know what Obama did." Kelly's son died after he stepped on a landmine in 2010. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/politics/president-donald-trump-john-kelly-obama-phone-call/))

5/ **Trump's nominee for drug czar has withdrawn his name from consideration** after it was reported the lawmaker guided legislation in Congress that made it [harder for the DEA](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/16/day-270/#11-trump-will-declare-a-national-opi) to act against giant drug companies. "Rep.Tom Marino has informed me that he is withdrawing his name from consideration as drug czar," Trump tweeted. "Tom is a fine man and a great Congressman!"

6/ **The Senate Intelligence Committee has requested documents and testimony Michael Flynn's son**. They have not received a response, yet. Michael G. Flynn was involved in the day-to-day operations of Flynn Intel Group and served as his father's chief of staff. The committee could issue a subpoena if he doesn’t comply, but he would likely assert his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. The younger Flynn is also the subject of Robert Mueller's criminal and counterintelligence investigation.
