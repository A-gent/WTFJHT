1/ **Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump tried to conceal the purpose of Trump Jr.'s meeting with the Russian lawyer**. Prosecutors want to know what Trump's role was in crafting Trump Jr.'s response to reports about the meeting. The White House initially said Trump only ["weighed in"](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/01/day-194/#2-the-white-house-said-trump-only-we) on Trump Jr.'s statement about the Russia meeting. It was later reported that Trump [personally dictated](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/01/day-194/#1-trump-personally-dictated-trump-jr) Trump Jr.'s statement about the meeting.

2/ **Michael Cohen said he didn’t inform Trump that he had sent the email to Putin’s top press official asking for “assistance”** in arranging a licensing deal for a Trump Tower in Moscow. The Trump Organization attorney [sent the email in January 2016](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/28/day-221/#4-trumps-attorney-sent-an-email-to-p) to Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s top press aide, at the recommendation of Felix Sater, a Russian-American businessman who was serving as a broker on the deal. Cohen said he never heard back from Peskov and the project never got off the ground.

3/ **Trump warned North Korea that "all options are on the table" after it fired a missile over Japan**.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley added that “something serious has to happen.” ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/29/trump-shinzo-abe-phone-call-north-korea-242123) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/28/politics/north-korea-launch-unidentified-projectile/index.html))

4/ **Trump fired the organizer for his Phoenix speech because he was upset about the crowd size and TV coverage**. After his speech, Trump had his top security aide inform longtime aide George Gigicos that he’d never manage a Trump rally again. Gigicos has organized all of Trump’s main campaign events and occasional rallies since entering office and is one of the four longest-serving aides to the president. Gigicos joins Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus, Stephen Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, and Anthony Scaramucci, who have all resigned or been fired.
