\*\*\* MORNING EDITION : UPDATES IN PROGRESS \*\*\*

1/ **The Department of Justice is arguing that the Civil Rights Act does not protect gay employees from discrimination**. The DOJ filed an amicus brief (meaning the government isn’t a party in the case) weighing in on a private employment lawsuit. They argue that while Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act bars the discrimination in the workplace based on “race, color, religion, sex or national origin," it does not protect employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation despite “notable changes in societal and cultural attitudes.” The brief claimed that the federal government has a “substantial and unique interest” in the proper interpretation of Title VII because it's the largest employer in the country.

2/ **The Joint Chiefs said there will be “no modifications” to the military’s transgender policy** until Trump clarifies what he meant in a series of surprise tweets. “I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement on the transgender policy by the President,” Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a memo to military leaders. “There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance.” ([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/joint-chiefs-no-transgender-policy-changes-until-trump-clarifies-tweets-n787076) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/27/trump-transgender-military-ban-no-modification-241029))

3/ **Trump has discussed a recess appointment to replace Jeff Sessions** if he leaves the job in an effort to sidestep Senate oversight. Democrats have said they'll use parliamentary stalling tactics to prevent the Senate from formally adjourning throughout the upcoming August break — in part to prevent Trump from being able to unilaterally install a new attorney general.

4/ **The Trump administration threatened retribution against Alaska over Lisa Murkowski's no vote on health care**. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called Alaska's other GOP senator, Dan Sullivan, to deliver a "troubling message" that left him worried "that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs, and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop." ([Alaska Dispatch News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2017/07/26/trump-administration-signals-that-murkowskis-health-care-vote-could-have-energy-repercussions-for-alaska/))

5/ **Mitch McConnell is expected to unveil the GOP’s “skinny repeal” bill during today's “vote-a-rama."** The bill will rollback the individual mandate, partially repeal of the employer mandate, defund Planned Parenthood for one year, and provide more money for community health centers. The skinny repeal isn’t really that skinny at all. The CBO estimated 15 million to 16 million Americans would lose coverage and expects premiums to rise 20% in the individual market. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/27/obamacare-repeal-republicans-status-241025) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/heres-whats-in-skinny-repeal-2466204086.html) / [Vox](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/27/16050210/health-care-skinny-repeal-consequences))

6/ **House conservatives said the skinny repeal is untenable**. Even if Senate Republicans can pass their minimalist plan to alter the ACA, uniting with their House colleagues to enact a bill would be far more challenging. Mark Meadows, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said a skinny repeal would be “dead on arrival” in the House.
