1/ **Trump met with Putin’s top diplomats at the White House**. The talks came one day after Trump fired the FBI Director, who was overseeing an investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Sergey Lavrov met with Rex Tillerson earlier in the day and sarcastically acknowledged the dismissal of James Comey by saying "Was he fired? You're kidding. You're kidding." The Kremlin said Trump's firing of Comey will have no effect on bilateral relations between the two countries. Trump also met with Sergey Kislyak, a key figure in the Flynn investigation.

2/ **Trump defended firing Comey and said both parties will thank him in an early morning tweetstorm**. Trump justified dismissing Comey, saying Democrats and Republicans had lost faith in his leadership due to "scandals." Trump then mocked his critics and suggested that a Democratic senator be investigated after appearing on TV condemning the president’s action.

* **Sessions was told to find reasons to fire Comey**. To justify the decision, Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, cited Comey’s handling of the probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server, which Trump repeatedly promoted during the 2016 campaign.

3/ **Days before he was fired, Comey asked for a significant increase in money and personnel for the Russia  investigation**. Comey asked for the resources during a meeting last week with Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who wrote the Justice Department’s memo used to justify his firing.

4/ **Mitch McConnell rejected calls for a special prosecutor or independent commission to investigate Russia’s election meddling** in the wake of the firing of FBI Director James Comey. The Senate Majority Leader said, "Today we'll no doubt hear calls for a new investigation, which could only serve to impede the current work being done." ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/10/mcconnell-rejects-call-for-special-prosecutor-238206))

5/ **Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of Michael Flynn seeking business records**. The subpoenas represent the first sign of a significant escalation of activity in the FBI's broader Trump-Russia investigation.

* **Senate Intelligence Chairman threatened to subpoena Trump campaign aides if they ignore deadlines to turn over records**. Richard Burr has received just two responses to an initial request for information. The panel has asked a number of Trump campaign aides to provide records, including Page, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn.

6/ **Rudy Giuliani is visiting the White House, but says he's not a candidate for FBI director**. A source close to the president confirmed Giuliani was in consideration for the position. Giuliani, hanging out at the Trump International Hotel  in Washington, D.C., said he was "in town for several business meetings, law firm meetings."

7/ **The Senate failed to revoke Obama-era methane rules**. The measure would have given oil and gas companies a reprieve from methane emission rules on federal land. The defeat is a blow to oil and natural gas drillers who had made this a top priority. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-idUSKBN18620F) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-10/senate-fails-to-advance-methane-rule-repeal-as-democrats-unite))

8/ **The Census Bureau director resigns as the agency faces a funding debate over the 2020 Census**. Congress wants the cost of the 2020 count to not exceed the cost of the 2010 count, the bureau wanting to implement a new system that relies more on electronic data collection, which was promoted as a cost-saving measure.
