1/ **Trump’s lawyers are discussing his authority to grant pardons** to aides, family members, and himself in connection with the Russia probe. Because no president has ever pardoned himself, there is no precedent, which leaves the question open: can a president use their constitutional power to pardon themselves? The power to pardon is granted in Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, which gives the president the power to “grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-lawyers-seek-to-undercut-muellers-russia-investigation/2017/07/20/232ebf2c-6d71-11e7-b9e2-2056e768a7e5_story.html))

2/ **Trump’s lawyers are exploring ways to stymie Robert Mueller's Russia investigation**. They're scouring the professional and political backgrounds of investigators hired by the special counsel, looking for conflicts of interest they could use to discredit the investigation or force members of the team to recuse themselves – and possibly build a case to fire Mueller.

3/ **Trump reshuffled his legal team**. Marc Kasowitz, Trump's longtime personal attorney who has been the lead lawyer on the Russia investigation, will step aside as the role requires Washington-centric expertise. John Dowd and Jay Sekulow will now be Trump's primary personal attorneys for the investigation, with Dowd in the lead. From inside the White House, Ty Cobb will take the lead on the investigation from a legal and communications perspective.

4/ **Robert Mueller asked White House staff to preserve all documents relating to Trump Jr.'s meeting** with the Russian lawyer. The notice, called a document preservation request, asked White House staff to save any text messages, emails, notes, voicemails, and other communications and documentation from the June 2016 meeting.

5/ **The Russian lawyer Trump Jr. met with had Russian intelligence connections**. Natalia Veselnitskaya had previously represented Russia’s top spy agency, the Federal Security Service, in a land dispute in Moscow. There is no information that Veselnitskaya is an intelligence agent or an employee of the Russian government.

6/ **Trump tapped Anthony Scaramucci to be the new White House communications director**, a wealthy Wall Street financier. Scaramucci supported Trump's campaign, dealing with fundraising and appearing on cable TV as a frequent defender of the president. The role has been open since Mike Dubke resigned in May.

7/ **Sean Spicer resigned as the White House Press Secretary**, telling Trump he "vehemently disagreed" with the appointment of New York financier Anthony Scaramucci as communications director. After Trump asked Spicer to stay on after offering the job to Scaramucci, but Spicer declined, telling Trump he believed the appointment was a major mistake.

8/ **The spokesman for Trump’s legal team resigned two months after starting**. Mark Corallo said the dynamics in the White House were untenable and that there was "too much fighting all the time." He had grown frustrated with the operation and was concerned about whether he was being told the truth about various matters.
