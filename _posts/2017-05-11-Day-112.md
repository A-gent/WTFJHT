1/ **Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe vowed to report any meddling in the Russia probe** and said that the firing of Comey had not affected the Justice Department’s investigation. McCabe also told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comey had not lost the confidence of rank-and-file FBI agents, contradicting a claim by the White House. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/11/andrew-mccabe-vow-report-interference-fbi-russia-238265) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/live-briefing-james-comey-andrew-mccabe.html) / [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fbi-idUSKBN1871I7))

2/ **Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein threatened to resign** after the White House cast him as the prime reason to fire Comey and that Trump acted only on his recommendation. The day before, Trump gave Sessions and Rosenstein a directive: to explain in writing the case against Comey. The next day Trump fired Comey. The White House says it is unaware that the deputy attorney general threatened to quit.

3/ **The White House was misled about the role of the Russian photographer** and were surprised to see photos posted online showing Trump not only with Sergey Lavrov but also smiling and shaking hands with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Russian officials described the person as Lavrov's official photographer without disclosing that he also worked for Tass, a Russian state-owned news agency.

4/ **Trump is launching a commission to investigate voter fraud**. The effort will be spearheaded by Mike Pence and will look into allegations of improper voting and fraudulent voter registration in states and across the nation. Trump is expected to sign the executive order today. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/78ecd2bdc0ca46a5ad2a1afb4cd122a2/AP-sources:-Trump-to-launch-panel-to-investigate-voter-fraud) / [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-expected-launch-commission-election-integrity/story?id=47337222) / [CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/11/politics/trump-election-integrity-voter-fraud/index.html))

5/ **The Justice Department won’t say whether Jeff Sessions will recuse himself from any part of hiring the next FBI director**. In March, Sessions recused himself from investigations concerning the 2016 presidential campaigns. The DOJ declined to comment when asked if that policy would apply at all to the hiring process for the interim FBI director or the future nominee. Sessions has already interviewed candidates for interim FBI director.

6/ **Trump is "very likely" to visit FBI headquarters soon**. One intelligence official said that agents are more determined than ever to pursue probes into the alleged Russian interference in the presidential election and that Trump had "essentially declared war on a lot of people at the FBI. I think there will be a concerted effort to respond over time in kind." Separately, Trump will meet with Acting Director Andrew McCabe today to discuss the morale at the FBI.

7/ **Comey refused to preview his planned Senate testimony**. Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wanted a heads-up from Comey about what he would say at his May 3 hearing regarding his handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-comey-decision-idUSKBN1862WP))

8/ **Jason Chaffetz asked the inspector general to expand the Russia probe to include Comey's firing**. The Trump administration has denied Comey’s firing was related to the FBI’s Russia investigation. ([HuffPost](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chaffetz-calls-for-doj-to-expand-russia-probe-to-include-comeys-firing_us_5913c31ce4b066b42170f893) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/10/chaffetz-comey-firing-justice-238240) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/10/politics/jason-chaffetz-james-comey-firing-investigation/) / [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-comey-idUSL1N1IC1VC))

9/ **Trump admits White House is too combative**. He said it could be his fault, but added that "the only way you survive is to be combative." ([Time](http://time.com/4775040/donald-trump-time-interview-being-president/))

* **Trump thinks he invented the phrase "priming the pump."** ([The Economist](http://www.economist.com/Trumptranscript) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/11/politics/donald-trump-priming-the-pump/))

10/ **Trump is considering former congressman Mike Rogers to replace James Comey as FBI director**. Rogers is a former Intelligence Committee chair and FBI agent. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-11/trump-said-to-consider-ex-congressman-rogers-for-fbi-director))

## Perspective. 

**A sense of crisis deepens as Trump defends his abrupt dismissal of the FBI director**. On Capitol Hill, at least a half-dozen Republicans broke with their leadership to express concern or dismay about the firing of Comey. They stopped short of joining Democrats’ call for a special prosecutor to lead the continuing investigation of Russian contacts with Trump’s aides. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/us/politics/trump-comey-firing.html))

**Inside Trump’s anger and impatience — and his sudden decision to fire Comey**. Trump had long questioned Comey’s loyalty and judgment, and was infuriated by what he viewed as the director’s lack of action in recent weeks on leaks from within the federal government. By last weekend, he had made up his mind: Comey had to go. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-trumps-anger-and-impatience-prompted-him-to-fire-the-fbi-director/2017/05/10/d9642334-359c-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html))

**America isn't having a constitutional crisis**, but Trump may have just made one more likely in the future. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/constitutional-crisis-trump-comey/526089/))

**Trump after hours: From where he eats and sleeps, everything is going just great**. Now if only everyone else would see it that way. ([Time](http://time.com/donald-trump-after-hours/))
