<p class="lead">The cost of running What The Fuck Just Happened Today? isn't free. I'm donating my time and paying these costs out of pocket to keep the WTFJHT newsletter and site going. Here's a rough estimate of the monthly costs:</p>

**Hosting:**
The site is hosted on as a free <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Page</a>. It's great, but there are some limitations, including <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/" target="_blank">bandwidth limits</a> and it's difficult for a n00b like me to setup continious integration. 

I'm moving the site to an Amazon S3 bucket because it's highly scalable, reliable, fast, and generally an inexpensive data storage infrastructure option. _Monthly Cost:_ ~$20

**Site Search:**
This giant repository of news isn't very valuable if you can't find the what you're looking for. I've implemented <a href="https://www.algolia.com/" target="_blank">Algolia</a>, the best instant search option out there. _Monthly Cost:_ $59

**Email Sending:**
Oh boy, here's the most expensive part of running this site. I use <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> because the ease of use, templating, reporting, and pre-built forms are the best in the business. While there are cheaper options out there, the time-savings is huge. 

MailChimp charges by the number of subscribers you have AND the number of monthly emails sent. Check out the <a href="https://mailchimp.com/pricing/growing-business/" target="_blank">MailChimp Pricing Calculator</a> and stick 50,001 subscribers in there. Yeah. And, we're still growing... _Monthly Cost:_ At least $245

**Labor:**
While I'm donating my time to keep this project going, let's do some math and see what this would cost if I needed to make an income. Here's my daily breakdown:

* 1 hour researching and collecting stories
* 1 hour curating the daily post
* .5 hour setting up the post, cutting images, publishing, testing
* .5 hour distributing to Twitter and Facebook 
* .75 hour setting up and sending the newsletter 
* 1 hour site maintenance, help desk/support, etc

Okay, so ~4.75 hours/day. And, let's pretend I make the Federal minimum wage ($7.25). _Monthly Cost:_ 4.75 x 30 x $7.25 = <strong>$1,033.13</strong>

**TOTAL MONTHLY COST:**

$20 (hosting) + $59 (site search) + $245 (email) + $1,033.13 (labor) = <strong>$1,357.13</strong>
