<p style="text-align: center;"><small style="color: #9a9a9a;font-size: .75em;">As an alternative to the monthly options, you can support WTFJHT at <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26833">$50/yr</a> and <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26834">$100/yr</a>.</small></p>

<p class="lead"><strong>So here's the deal:</strong> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/meta/trump-creates-one-new-job/">This is my full-time job</a>, and I plan to keep doing this for as long as you keep supporting me. <i>If you find my work valuable and worthwhile, please consider becoming a member so I can continue to tell you what the fuck just happened today</i>.</p>

<p><strong>What's the money for?</strong> WTF Just Happened Today is a newsletter, blog, podcast, and community that chronicles the daily shock and awe in national politics. It's produced every morning by hand and updated throughout the day, with a newsletter sent out every afternoon, Monday through Friday. More than 200,000 people rely on WTFJHT to bring them the day's news as a concise and focused recap. The goal is simple: Make WTFJHT a sustainable, member-funded project that exists for as long as necessary. To do that we need to cover all the costs associated with hosting, email delivery, site search, the community forum, web development, "salary," health insurance, freelancers, the podcast, and more.</p>

<p>Members of all levels will receive the monthly "What's up with WTF" newsletter, be added to a private channel in the <a href="https://talk.whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/">WTF Community Center</a>, and feel good about supporting today's essential newsletter and blog. Your email address and personal information will never be shared with anyone for any purpose. Period. You will, however, receive occasional emails from Memberful regarding invoices and renwals.</p>

<p><strong>WTFJHT Values and Editorial Policy.</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Transparency.</strong> WTFJHT is open sourced and hosted as a public <a href="https://github.com/mkiser/WTFJHT" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. Readers are encouraged to improve WTFJHT by making edit requests to fix grammar, typos, facts, sources, etc., as well as to contribute code.</li>
	<li><strong>Neutral-ish.</strong> WTFJHT isn't partisan. It does not offer commentary, opinion, or analysis. Instead, WTFJHT focuses on letting the facts speak for themselves and that's it. Bias is the byproduct of being a human making decisions about the relative importance of something. Sorry.</li>
	<li><strong>Reputable sources.</strong> I always cite and clearly link to the original source material. Where appropriate, I'll include additional sources to other publications reporting the same information.</li>
	<li><strong>Clear expectations.</strong> The premise is simple: state what happened, what the facts are, and cite the source. Next.</li>
	<li><strong>No strings attached.</strong> There's no business model trickery here. No ads. No paywalls. No selling of data. I have a website and a newsletter, and I'm supported directly by my audience.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Still not convinced?</strong> Here's <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/press">what the smartest people on the Internet</a> are saying about What The Fuck Just Happened Today.</p>

<ul>
	<li>"This is the site I’ve been waiting for." –<a href="https://twitter.com/amyoleary/status/827006733142851587" target="_blank">Amy O'Leary</a>, Chief Story Officer and Editorial Director at Upworthy</li>
	<li>"Single subject, distinct tone, clear formatting, total understanding of what its audience wants. @WTFJHT is the best email newsletter." –<a href="https://twitter.com/DaveLeeBBC/status/830907636006547456" target="_blank">Dave Lee</a>, BBC Silicon Valley Reporter</li>
	<li>"@WTFJHT is a brilliant journalistic response to an urgent civic need." –<a href="https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/830562518674317314" target="_blank">Jeff Jarvis</a>, Director, Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism</li>

<p><small><strong>Where's the $1/mo option?</strong> I dropped the $1/mo option because the credit card fees are outrageous. On a $1 pledge, 34% goes to the credit card processing companies. That's a lot of wasted money compared to a $5 pledge, where only 10% goes to the credit card companies. If you still want to support WTFJHT at the equivalent of $1/mo, I'm offering a <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26832">$12/yr option</a>. Want to pledge monthly, but $5/mo is too high? Here's a <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26828">$3/mo</a> option, where 14% of your money is lost to fees.</small></p>

<p><small><strong>Just want to make a one-time donation?</strong> While recurring memberships are preferred, I'm happy to accomodate four one-time donation options at <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26835">$25</a>, <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26836">$50</a>, <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26837">$100</a>, and <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26838">$200</a>.</small></p>

<p><small><strong>How much does this thing cost to run anyway?</strong> Glad you asked! I did some back of the envelope math and I came up with $10,071/month. That's a pretty conservative estimate, to be honest. If you're interested in how I arrived at that number, I've outlined <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faq/">the cost of running WTFJHT in the FAQ</a>.</p>
