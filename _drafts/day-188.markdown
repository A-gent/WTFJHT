1/ **Senate Republicans shot down their own repeal-and-replace bill** last night as nine of the 52 Republicans voted against it. The repeal-and-replace bill was a compromise measure meant to appeal to both conservatives and moderate Republicans. Mitch McConnell needed 60 votes to pass the bill. Instead, the vote failed 43-57 just hours after the Senate had narrowly voted to begin debate on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Today, Senators will consider a straight repeal of Obamacare without providing a replacement, which is also expected to fail.
