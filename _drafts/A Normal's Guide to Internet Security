# A Normal's Guide to Internet Security

Protect yourself in 20-minutes or less – or your money back.

**YOU SHOULD KNOW**: Your interest in privacy will likely ensure you’re targeted by the NSA. ([MakeUseOf](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/interest-privacy-will-ensure-youre-targeted-nsa/))

### 1/ Two-Factor Authentication

You know when you login to your bank with your username and password, but then they send you a text message or email with a six-digit code you have to enter to continue? That's two-factor authentication. And it's probably the most important thing you can do to protect yourself on the internet. 

**Enable two-factor authentication**. Go through and enable 2FA on the following services: Amazon, Apple, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Instagram, Microsoft, Paypal, Slack, Twitter, Venmo, or WhatsApp. Check [twofactorauth.org](https://twofactorauth.org/) for a complete list of apps and services that support 2FA.

**Bank and email**. Enable 2FA for these, too. 

**Financial**. Yeah, enable 2FA for any online investing you do, too.

optional – **Make life easier**. Use an authenticator app to make logging in easier. Now when you login, instead of waiting for a text message, you just pull out the app and punch in the six-digit code listed for your service. [Authy](https://www.authy.com/tutorials/) and [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) are two free options for phone. 

### 2/ Passwords

You already know what to do. Protect yourself. Just do it. And, just because you're using two-factor authentication for everything doesn't mean you can skimp on your password.

**Use strong passwords**. 12-14 characters using a mix of capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and punctuation. Don’t use the same password for every site or service. Change your passwords twice year (I change mine when I go to the dentist). Don't keep a file or email to yourself with all your passwords listed. 

**Your phone**. Turn on your phone’s password protection. Use as strong a password as you can. Use the fingerprint reader.

**Your computer**. Set a login password. Require a password immediately after waking from sleep and when the screen saver begins. Lock your screen when you walk away from your computer.

optional – **Password manager**. I personally don't use a password manager as I find it's easier to remember strong passwords than it is to consistently use the tool for everything. That said, both [1Password](https://1password.com/) and [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) are good, multi-device options.

### 3/ Ad Blocker

An ad blocker does exactly what you think: they prevent ads from loading on web pages. This is great for several reasons: faster web browsing and less ugly web sites. But the best reason is that they also block those sneaky trackers used to serve you targeted ads, among other things. 

**Install uBlock Origin**. It's free and takes two seconds to install on your browser. Set it and forget it. Install it for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/). [Safari](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock-Safari) installation is a little trickier – you'll have to do it manually. [Follow the instructions here](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock-Safari/tree/safari/dist#install) to download and install (it takes five total clicks).

### 4/ HTTPS

HTTPS works by encrypting traffic between the websites you visit and the device you're using. Think of it as a way to protect yourself against inappropriate eavesdropping on your personal information, like emails, e-commerce transactions, what you look at on the internet, and more.

**Install HTTPS Everywhere**. This free browser extension from the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) will encrypt your communication with most major websites by loading the content over an HTTPS connection rather than a standard HTTP connection when possible. Get it here: [EFF.org/https-everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)

### 5/ Third-party blocker

In the same way you want to use an ad blocker to prevent ads from following you around the internet, you want to prevent third-party tracking cookies from recording your browsing habits. 

**Install Privacy Badger**. This free browser extension keeps track of all the third-party tracking going on and blocks the cookies for you. Install it for [Chrome and Safari](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) here. Sorry Safari.

### 6/ VPN

A VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and is a way of using the internet in much more secure way. It works by encrypting your data (Private) and then routing your traffic through servers elsewhere in the world (Virtual Network) where no one can see what you are up to. If you use public wifi at a cafe, hotel, or airport, a VPN is essential.

**Choose a VPN**. A VPN you can trust costs money. Period. Most options that will cost you $10 or less per month. Check the [VPN Comparison Chart](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/simple-vpn-comparison-chart/) to learn more. 

**How to buy a VPN service**. I personally use [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/). It's barebones but it's also $3.33/mo. [Nord](https://nordvpn.com/pricing/) is another good choice, which looks to be more user-friendly and costs $5.75/mo.

**Using your VPN**. Some people leave their VPN on 24/7. Others only use it when they're doing something extra private (i.e. porn). If you're a normal person using the internet, I'd suggest this rule of thumb: if you're using the internet outside of your home, turn on your VPN. And, if you're going to login to your bank, Paypal, or some other financial institution, turn off your VPN – there's a good chance you'll get flagged and locked out of your account since you'll appear to be somewhere else in the world. 

**Check it's working**. With your VPN connected, head over to [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net/) and see where in the world you're connected. 

**The paranoid way to buy a VPN service**. If you consider yourself a normal person, then this is overkill. But here's how you should do it: Go buy a Starbucks gift card with the cash. Then use the gift card to purchase VPN access on [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com).
