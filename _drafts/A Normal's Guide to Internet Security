# A Normal's Guide to Internet Security

Protect yourself in 20-minutes or less – or your money back.

**YOU SHOULD KNOW**: Your interest in privacy will likely ensure you’re targeted by the NSA. ([MakeUseOf](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/interest-privacy-will-ensure-youre-targeted-nsa/))

### 1/ Passwords

You already know what to do. Protect yourself. Just do it. 

**Use strong passwords**. 12-14 characters using a mix of capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and punctuation. Don’t use the same password for every site or service. Change your passwords twice year (I change mine when I go to the dentist). Don't keep a file or email to yourself with all your passwords listed. 

**Your phone**. Turn on your phone’s password protection. Use as strong a password as you can. Use the fingerprint reader.

**Your computer**. Set a login password. Require a password immediately after waking from sleep and when the screen saver begins. Lock your screen when you walk away from your computer.

optional – **Password manager**. I personally hate password managers, but both 1Password and LastPass are good, multi-device options.

### 2/ Two-Factor Authentication

You know when you login to your bank with your username and password, but then they send you a text message or email with a six-digit code you have to enter to continue? That's two-factor authentication. And it's probably the most important thing you can do to protect yourself on the internet. 

**Enable two-factor authentication**. Go through and enable 2FA on the following services: Amazon, Apple, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Instagram, Microsoft, Paypal, Slack, Twitter, Venmo, or WhatsApp. Check [twofactorauth.org](https://twofactorauth.org/) for a complete list of apps and services that support 2FA.

**Bank and email**. Enable 2FA for these, too. 

**Financial**. Yeah, enable 2FA for any online investing you do, too.

optional – **Make life easier**. Use an authenticator app to make logging in easier. Now when you login, instead of waiting for a text message, you just pull out the app and punch in the six-digit code listed for your service. [Authy](https://www.authy.com/tutorials/) and [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) are two free options for phone. 

### 3/ Ad Blocker

Ad blockers do exactly what you think: they prevent ads from loading on web pages. This is great for several reasons: faster web browsing and less ugly web sites. But the best reason is that they also block sneaky trackers used to serve you targeted ads, among other things. 

**Install uBlock**. It's free and takes two seconds to install on your browser. Set it and forget it. Install it for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox at [uBlock.org](https://www.ublock.org/).

### 4/ HTTPS

HTTPS works by encrypting traffic between the websites you visit and the device you're using. Think of it as a way to protect yourself against inappropriate eavesdropping on your personal information, like emails, e-commerce transactions, what you look at on the internet, and more.

**Install HTTPS Everywhere**. This free browser extension from the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) will encrypt your communication with most major websites by loading the content over an HTTPS connection rather than a standard HTTP connection when possible.

### 5/ VPN

A VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and is a way of using the internet in much more secure way. It works by encrypting your data (Private) and then routing your traffic through servers elsewhere in the world (Virtual Network) where no one can see what you are up to. If you use public wifi, a VPN is a essential.

**Choose a VPN**. A VPN you can trust costs money. Period. Most options that will cost you $10 or less per month. Check the [VPN Comparison Chart](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/simple-vpn-comparison-chart/) to learn more. 

**How to buy a VPN service**. I personally use [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/). It's barebones but it's also $3.33/mo. [Nord](https://nordvpn.com/pricing/) is another good choice, which looks to be more user-friendly and costs $5.75/mo.

**Using your VPN**. Some people leave their VPN on 24/7. Others only use it when they're doing something extra private (i.e. porn). If you're a normal person using the internet, I'd suggest this rule of thumb: if you're using the internet outside of your home, turn on your VPN. And, if you're going to login to your bank, Paypal, or some other financial institution, turn off your VPN – there's a good chance you'll get flagged and locked out of your account. 

**The paranoid way to buy a VPN service**. If you consider yourself a normal person, then this is overkill. But here's how you should do it: Go buy a Starbucks gift card with the cash. Then use the gift card to purchase VPN access on [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com).
