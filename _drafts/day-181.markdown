TK/ **Trump and Putin met for nearly an hour in second, previously undisclosed meeting** during a dinner for G20 leaders. The White House called the meeting"brief" and said Trump spoke with Putin through Russia's translator. No other American officials other than Trump were present for the meeting.

TK/ **In response, Trump tweeted that the "Fake News" story about his "secret dinner with Putin is "'sick.'"** He added that "the Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest" and makes his previously undisclosed meeting with Putin "look sinister!"

TK/ **Trump is threatening to gut the Obamacare markets**, repeatedly telling aides and advisers that he wants to end the subsidy payments. The deadline for sending out the monthly Affordable Care Act subsidies to health plans is Thursday. Trump has the discretion to decide unilaterally whether the payments continue while a suit House Republicans won in 2014 is being appealed.
