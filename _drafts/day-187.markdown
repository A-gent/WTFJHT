TK/ **The health care repeal vote is too close to call and Senate Republicans don't know what's in their plan, but they'll vote anyway on the motion to proceed**. About a half-dozen senators are publicly undecided about whether to start debate on rolling back the Affordable Care Act. Mitch McConnell needs 50 out of the 52 Senate Republicans to support him on the motion to proceed. Several senators have said they want a "replace" plan ready to go before voting "yes." An agreed upon replace plan is not in place.

If the procedural vote passes, it doesn't mean the bill will. Once debate starts, senators can then introduce amendments to the bill. The final version will still need to pass with 50 votes. The bill would then have to pass the House before making its way to Trump's desk. If the procedural vote fails, it doesn't mean the bill is dead, either. McConnell is forcing the vote to put every senator on record.

TK/ **John McCain returned to the Senate for the health care vote** after being diagnosed with brain cancer last week. McCain's vote is critical to today's procedural vote. His absence would have left Senate Republicans with no margin of error.

TK/ Trump ripped Jeff Sessions on Twittering, calling him “very weak” when it comes to investigating Hillary Clinton. Trump has repeatedly taken aim at Sessions in recent days, leading to speculation that it’s just a matter of time before the attorney general resigns or is fired. The recent tweets come a day after Trump publicly described Sessions as "beleaguered."

TK/ **Trump has discussed replacing Jeff Sessions**. Move, viewed by some of Trump's team, is a strategy for firing special counsel Robert Mueller and end his investigation into the Trump campaign's efforts to coordinate with the Kremlin to influence the 2016 election. Sessions recently asked White House staff how he could patch up relations with Trump, but that went nowhere. Instead, Trump floated longtime ally Rudy Giuliani as a possible replacement for Sessions.
