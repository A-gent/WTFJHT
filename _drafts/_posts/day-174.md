TK/ **Investigators are examining if Trump's digital operation helped guide Russia's election meddling**. The digital team was overseen by Jared Kushner. The House and Senate Intelligence committees and the Justice Department are focusing on whether Trump’s campaign pointed Russian cyber operatives to certain voting jurisdictions in states that supported Hillary Clinton.

TK/ **The White House won’t say whether Jared Kushner still has a security clearance** after Kushner Kushner omitted the interaction with the Russian lawyer on his [application for a security clearance](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/11/Day-173/#2-the-email-sent-to-trump-jr-said-th). He later included the meeting on a supplemental form. Sarah Huckabee Sanders dodged question, saying the White House has “never discussed the security clearance” of a staff member.

TK/ **Trump’s lawyer in the Russia probe isn't seeking a security clearance**. Several lawyers who have represented presidents and senior government officials said they could not imagine how Marc Kasowitz could handle a case full of sensitive material without a clearance.

TK/ Trump's other lawyer said President didn't see email until Trump Jr. released it Jay Sekulow

"The President, by the way, never saw an email -- did not see the email -- until it was seen today," Sekulow said, referring to Donald Trump Jr.'s disclosure of the email thread on Twitter shortly before a Times story containing the same information was published.

TK/ **Trump tweets that he has "very little time for watching T.V.,"** saying his "W.H. is functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things." ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/12/trump-tweet-i-have-little-time-to-watch-tv-240447))
