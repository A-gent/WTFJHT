TK/ **The White House won’t say whether Jared Kushner still has a security clearance** after Kushner Kushner omitted the interaction with the Russian lawyer on his [application for a security clearance](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/11/Day-173/#2-the-email-sent-to-trump-jr-said-th). He later included the meeting on a supplemental form. Sarah Huckabee Sanders dodged question, saying the White House has “never discussed the security clearance” of a staff member.

TK/ **Trump’s lawyer in the Russia probe isn't seeking a security clearance**. Several lawyers who have represented presidents and senior government officials said they could not imagine how Marc Kasowitz could handle a case full of sensitive material without a clearance.

TK/ **Trump tweets that he has "very little time for watching T.V.,"** saying his "W.H. is functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things." ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/12/trump-tweet-i-have-little-time-to-watch-tv-240447))
