poll/ **Americans are split – 42%-42% – over whether Trump should be removed from office**. 46% say Trump won't complete his first term, while 27%, are confident that he'll serve all four years of his term. A third said they would be upset if Trump was impeached, while an equal third said they would be upset if he's not.
