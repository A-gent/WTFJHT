  <p>1/ <strong>Photos comparing Trump’s inauguration crowd to the Women’s March</strong> (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/21/politics/womens-march-donald-trump-inauguration-sizes/index.html">CNN</a>)</p>

<p>2/ <strong>White House press secretary Sean Spicer attacked media for accurately reporting inauguration crowds.</strong> “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period,” Spicer said, contradicting all available data. Aerial photos have indicated that former president Barack Obama’s first inauguration attracted a much larger crowd. Nielsen ratings show that Obama also had a bigger television audience. Spicer, at times almost yelling while reading a prepared statement, took no questions. (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/21/media/sean-spicer-press-secretary-statement/index.html">CNN</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Trump used his first full day in office on Saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media</strong>, falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/politics/trump-white-house-briefing-inauguration-crowd-size.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>4/ <strong>Trump says he has “running war” with media, criticizes the “dishonest media,” gets facts wrong, in CIA speech.</strong> (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/21/media/donald-trump-war-with-the-media/">CNN</a>)</p>

<p>5/ At CIA headquarters, Trump denies feud, lashed out at critics, boasted of his magazine covers, and <strong>exaggerated the size of the crowd at his inauguration.</strong> (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-cia-langley-233971">Politico</a>)</p>

<p>6/ <strong>Trump’s real war isn’t with the media. It’s with facts.</strong> He needs to delegitimize the media because he needs to delegitimize facts. (<a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/21/14347952/trump-spicer-press-conference-crowd-size-inauguration">Vox</a>)</p>
