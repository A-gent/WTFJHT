  <p>1/ <strong>US Diplomats consider filing “dissent” over immigration ban.</strong> Dozens of Foreign Service officers and other career diplomats stationed around the world are so concerned about President Donald Trump’s new executive order restricting Syrian refugees and other immigrants from entering the United States that they are contemplating taking the rare step of sending a formal objection to senior State Department officials in Washington. (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-us-diplomats-filing-dissent-immigration-ban/story?id=45135038">ABC News</a>)</p>

<p>Here’s the <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3438487/Dissent-Memo.pdf">draft of the memo</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UPDATE: State Department expected to issue cable protesting Trump immigration ban. Officers warn the restrictions will hurt U.S. efforts to prevent terrorist attacks. (<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/state-department-expected-to-issue-cable-protesting-trump-immigration-ban-1485790811">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>

<p>2/ <strong>The State Department’s Dissent Channel is a mechanism for employees to confidentially express policy disagreement</strong>, created in 1971 as a response to concerns within the Department over the government’s handling of the Vietnam War.

<p>3/ <strong>Kellyanne Conway defends Trump’s criticism of GOP Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, saying Republicans need to back his leadership.</strong> Conway also asserted that Trump had accomplished an impressive amount in the short time since he took office, calling his achievements “breathtaking.”

  <li>Related: McCain, Graham broke the GOP silence on Capitol Hill, issuing a <strong>scathing condemnation of Trump’s ban on travel</strong> to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries.

</ul>

<p>5/ <strong>How Trump’s rush to enact an immigration ban unleashed global chaos.</strong> The confusion that erupted is the story of a White House that rushed to enact with little regard for basic governing. As Trump was signing the sweeping executive order on Friday to shut the borders to refugees and Muslims, the secretary of homeland security was on a White House conference call getting his first full briefing on the global shift in policy. (<a href="http://nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/politics/donald-trump-rush-immigration-order-chaos.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Halfway into the briefing, someone on the call looked up at a television in his office. ‘The president is signing the executive order that we’re discussing,’ the official said, stunned.”</p>
