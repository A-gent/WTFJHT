  <p>1/ <strong>Acting Attorney General declares Justice Department won’t defend Trump’s immigration order.</strong> The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote Tuesday on Trump’s pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, whose views align much more closely with the president’s.

<p>3/ <strong>Obama rejects comparison between Trump’s immigration policy and his own</strong>, saying he fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion, and encourages protests.

<p>4/ <strong>Democrats prepare bill to overturn Trump immigration order.</strong> The bill would declare the order “null and void” and bar federal agencies from using any funds to enforce it. The measure faces long odds given that Republicans control Congress and the White House.

<p>6/ <strong>Trump’s hard-line actions have an intellectual godfather: Jeff Sessions.</strong> The senator lobbied for a “shock and awe” period of executive action that would rattle Congress, impress Trump’s base and catch his critics unaware. Trump opted for a slightly slower pace, because he wanted to maximize news coverage by spreading out his directives over several weeks. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-hard-line-actions-have-an-intellectual-godfather-jeff-sessions/2017/01/30/ac393f66-e4d4-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>7/ <strong>Kellyanne Conway defends Trump’s criticism of GOP Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, saying Republicans need to back his leadership.</strong> Conway also asserted that Trump had accomplished an impressive amount in the short time since he took office, calling his achievements “breathtaking.” (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/conway-gop-senators-support-president/story?id=45140067">ABC News</a>)</p>
