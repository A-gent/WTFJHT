  <p>1/ <strong>Donald Trump has named only 29 of his 660 executive department appointments</strong>, the Partnership for Public Service said. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/trump-cabinet-picks-inauguration.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>2/ Trump boasted his inauguration would have an “unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout.” <strong>But aerial shots of the National Mall from Obama’s 2009 inauguration and today show that isn’t likely.</strong> (<a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14332462/photos-crowd-trump-inauguration-vs-obama">Vox</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>All references to climate change have been deleted</strong> from the White House website. The only mention of climate on Trump’s new website is under his “America First Energy Plan” page, in which he vows to destroy Obama’s Climate Action Plan, which is a government-wide plan to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change. (<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-references-to-climate-change-have-been-deleted-from-the-white-house-website">Motherboard</a>)</p>

<p>4/ <strong>New poll shows Obamacare is more popular than Donald Trump.</strong> Fox News finds that 50% of voters feel favorably about the Affordable Care Act compared to Donald Trump, whom 42% view favorably. President Obama, received an approval rating of 60%. (<a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14335268/obamacare-more-popular-than-trump-poll">Vox</a>)</p>

<p>5/ <strong>There’s no record Trump has resigned from his companies.</strong> To transfer control of his companies, the president has to submit filings in Florida, Delaware and New York. We spoke to officials in each of those states. (<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-promised-to-resign-from-his-companies-but-no-record-hes-done-so">ProPublica</a>)</p>
