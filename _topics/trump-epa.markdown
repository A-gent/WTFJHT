<p class="lead">Here's what we know so far about Trump's efforts to dismantle the EPA.</p>

<p><strong>The EPA removed from its website climate change resources</strong> that local governments used to address climate change, curb emissions, and devise strategies for adapting to weather extremes. An EPA spokesman said the resources have been archived and are available by searching through the agency’s archive. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/climate/epa-climate-change.html">New York Times</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>The EPA issued new guidelines that claim higher radiation levels "usually" pose "no harmful health effects."</strong> The change is part of the EPA's "guidance" on messaging and communications in the event of a nuclear power plant meltdown or dirty bomb attack, and sets a level of acceptable radiation ten times the drinking water standard for radiation recommended under Obama. A 2007 version of the same document said that no level of radiation is safe and concluded that "the current body of scientific knowledge tells us this." (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-16/epa-says-higher-radiation-levels-pose-no-harmful-health-effect">Bloomberg</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Scott Pruitt directed the EPA to stop settling lawsuits with environmental groups</strong> behind closed doors, saying the groups have had too much influence on regulation. Pruitt sued the agency he now runs more than a dozen times while he was the attorney general of Oklahoma. The practice of "sue and settle" is used by green groups to push the EPA to speed up regulation on issues such as air and water pollution, as well as climate change. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-lawsuits/epa-head-seeks-to-avoid-settlements-with-green-groups-idUSKBN1CL2HK">Reuters</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>The phrase "climate change" does not appear in the EPA's draft four-year strategic plan</strong>. Scott Pruitt outlines his agency's prioritizes as a focus on the "core mission" of clean air, land, and water, "rebalance" the federal role in environmental regulation, and enforce laws "as Congress intended." The plan does not mention carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/11/politics/epa-climate-report/index.html">CNN</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Scott Pruitt wants to eliminate the federal tax credits for the wind and solar power industries</strong>, saying the credits prevent utility companies from making the best decisions about power generation. “I’d let them stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sources," the EPA chief said.  (<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/354594-epa-chief-id-do-away-with-wind-solar-tax-credits">The Hill</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-09/epa-chief-calls-for-ending-wind-tax-credits-to-help-coal-survive">Bloomberg</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Trump nominated a coal lobbyist to help lead the EPA</strong>. Andrew Wheeler, who is an outspoken denier of established science on climate change, would become the second most powerful person at the EPA. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/climate/trump-epa-andrew-wheeler.html">New York Times</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>The EPA will propose repealing the Clean Power Plan</strong>, a central piece of Obama's plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants, fight climate change, and meet emissions goals promised in the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump signed an <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/03/28/Day-68/#3-trump-signs-an-executive-order-to">executive order in March</a> directing the EPA to start the legal process of withdrawing and rewriting the Clean Power Plan. The EPA will solicit input on “developing a rule similarly intended to reduce CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel electric utility generating units.”  (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-carbon-exclusive/exclusive-epa-to-propose-repealing-obamas-climate-regulation-document-idUSKCN1C90BY">Reuters</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Scott Pruitt has held almost daily meetings with top corporate executives and lobbyists from all the sectors that he regulates</strong>. The EPA chief has held almost no meetings with environmental groups or consumer or public health advocates. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/us/politics/epa-scott-pruitt-calendar-industries-coal-oil-environmentalists.html">New York Times</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Tom Price will repay taxpayers for his private jet travel</strong>, saying "I regret the concerns this has raised regarding the use of taxpayer dollars." He added: "The taxpayers won’t pay a dime for my seat on those planes." Price has taken at least 26 charter flights costing more than $400,000 since May to conduct official business. Price, however, will only reimburse taxpayers for just under $52,000. Meanwhile, EPA chief Scott Pruitt has taken at least four noncommercial and military flights since mid-February, costing taxpayers more than $58,000. House Democrats introduced legislation to prevent Trump administration officials from using private jets with taxpayers funds. (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/28/tom-price-private-charter-flights-reimburse-243267">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/09/27/epas-pruitt-took-charter-military-flights-that-cost-taxpayers-more-than-58000/">Washington Post</a> / <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/352913-democrats-unveil-bills-to-ban-cabinet-members-private-jet-travel">The Hill</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Scott Pruitt doesn't want to talk about climate change right now</strong>. The EPA chief said that with Hurricane Irma, “to have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm – versus helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm – is misplaced." Experts have said that climate change has contributed to the increased strength of hurricanes this season. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/07/politics/scott-pruitt-hurricanes-climate-change-interview/index.html">CNN</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Almost 400 EPA employees have left the agency in recent days</strong>, mostly due to buyouts. When combined with retirements in the same time window, the departures amount to a workforce reduction of about 2.5%. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hundreds-of-epa-workers-leave-in-recent-days-1504660207">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>The EPA hasn't visited 13 of the 41 Superfund sites in Texas that are “experiencing possible damage” because they had “not been accessible by response personnel."</strong> The Associated Press, however, accessed 12 of the sites by vehicle or on foot, and used a boat to reach that last Houston-area Superfund site that was flooded. The EPA, citing Breitbart, labeled the Associated Press' reporting as “misleading” but did not dispute any of the facts of the story. (<a href="https://www.apnews.com/27796dd13b9549b0ac76aded58a15122/AP-EXCLUSIVE:-Toxic-waste-sites-flooded-in-Houston-area">Associated Press</a> / <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/epa-denies-houston-superfund-sites-being-neglected.html">New York Magazine</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Scott Pruitt cast doubt on the idea that climate change poses a threat to the US</strong>, despite a recent report concluding that <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/08/day-201/#1-scientists-fear-the-trump-administ">Americans are already feeling the effects of climate change</a>. The EPA chief called for “red team/blue team” to try and challenge what he says is “so-called settled science” on climate change. Pruitt is skeptical of the scientific consensus that human activity is far and away the primary cause of climate change. NOAA and the American Meteorological Society published their annual <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/international-report-confirms-2016-was-third-consecutive-year">"State of the Climate" report</a> today, which concludes that 2016 was the third consecutive warmest year on record in 137 years of record keeping, with the highest levels of greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level, and sea surface temperature. (<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/345937-epa-head-casts-doubt-on-supposed-threat-from-climate-change">The Hill</a>)</p>				  

<p>The EPA is one of 13 agencies that must approve the report by August 18th, which is headed by Scott Pruitt, who has said he does not believe that carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming.</p>				  

<p><strong>A federal court blocked the EPA's effort to suspend an Obama restriction on methane emissions</strong> from new oil and gas wells. The court concluded that the EPA could reconsider a 2016 rule limiting methane and smog-forming pollutants emitted by oil and gas wells, but couldn't delay the effective date while it rewrites the regulation. The EPA had proposed extending the initial delay to two years. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/climate/court-blocks-epa-effort-to-suspend-obama-era-methane-rule.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-court-blocks-trump-epa-on-air-pollution/2017/07/03/464a7344-601e-11e7-84a1-a26b75ad39fe_story.html">Washington Post</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Scott Pruitt is launching an initiative to "critique" climate science at the EPA</strong>. Pruitt's stated that he believes the climate is changing and humans have some role, but is skeptical that greenhouse gases are the primary cause of climate change, despite overwhelming scientific consensus. (<a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060056858">Climatewire</a> / <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/340223-epa-head-to-launch-initiative-to-challenge-climate-science">The Hill</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>The EPA, the Army, and the US Army Corps of Engineers are proposing a new rule to rollback Obama's Waters of the United States</strong>. Scott Pruitt's EPA has prioritized the economic concerns of industry and agricultural interests over environmental concerns. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-epa-move-to-rescind-obama-administrations-clean-water-rule-1498586400">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>The EPA plans to buy out more than 1,200 employees this summer</strong> as part of a push by the administration to shrink the agency Trump once promised to eliminate “in almost every form.” It would be about an 8% reduction of the current 15,000-person EPA workforce. The administration has also proposed a 31% cut to the EPA budget. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/06/20/epa-plans-to-buy-out-more-than-1200-employees-by-the-end-of-summer/">Washington Post</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>EPA</strong> – 31.4% decrease</p>				  

<p><strong>The EPA may allow a massive gold and copper mine at the headwaters of one of Alaska’s salmon fisheries</strong>. The Trump administration will allow a Canadian-owned company to seek a federal permit to build a mine near Bristol Bay. In 2014, the EPA released a study that concluded large-scale mining in the bay posed significant risk to salmon and could adversely affect Alaska Natives in the region. (<a href="https://apnews.com/47609e10bc3f473eb33b2302024ed1f4/EPA-may-allow-massive-mine-near-pristine-Alaskan-bay">Associated Press</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>The EPA dismissed half of its scientific advisers on a review board</strong>, which provides guidance on whether research has sufficient rigor and integrity. The move, which Scott Pruitt cited as his desire to make a “clean break” with the Obama administration, came as a surprise to members of the board, who had been informed both in January and recently by EPA career staff members, that they would be kept on for another term. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/05/07/epa-dismisses-half-of-its-scientific-advisers-on-key-board-citing-clean-break-with-obama-administration/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/us/politics/epa-dismisses-members-of-major-scientific-review-board.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>The EPA removed its climate science site the day before march on Washington</strong>. The website previously housed data on greenhouse gas emissions and reports on the effects of climate change and its impact on human health. (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/29/epa-trump-website-climate-change-peoples-climate-march" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>The EPA becomes a target after Trump asks manufacturers how to boost domestic manufacturing</strong>. Nearly half of the 168 recommendations submitted were aimed at the EPA. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/epa-emerges-as-major-target-after-trump-solicits-policy-advice-from-industry/2017/04/16/87a8a55a-205d-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Scott Pruitt will receive around-the-clock security detail as the EPA budget shrinks by 31%</strong>. The proposed budget would double the agency’s infrastructure and operations staff as it gets slashed from $8.1 billion to $5.7 billion, eliminating a quarter of the agency’s 15,000 jobs. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/climate/trump-epa-budget-cuts.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>The EPA moves to dismantle programs that protect kids from lead paint</strong>. The proposed cuts would roll back programs aimed at reducing lead risks by $16.61 million and more than 70 employees. 38 million U.S. homes contain lead-based paint. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/04/05/trumps-epa-moves-to-defund-programs-that-protect-children-from-lead/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>EPA chief Scott Pruitt rejected the agency's scientific conclusion to permanently ban one of the most widely used insecticides at farms nationwide</strong>. The agency’s own chemical safety experts said that exposure to chlorpyrifos potentially causes learning and memory declines. The insecticide was banned in 2000 for use in most household settings, but is still used at about 40,000 farms on about 50 different types of crops, ranging from almonds to apples. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/epa-insecticide-chlorpyrifos.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Trump signs an executive order to dismantle Obama's climate change policies</strong>. Trump celebrated the move as a way to promote energy independence and restore thousands of lost coal industry jobs. The executive order directs the EPA to start the legal process of withdrawing and rewriting the Clean Power Plan. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/climate/trump-executive-order-climate-change.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>EPA chief Scott Pruitt says Trump will sign a new executive order this week that unravels Obama's plan to curb global warming</strong>. The order will undo the Clean Power Plan, which restricts greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants. (<a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-to-sign-order-undoing-obama-clean-power-plan" target="_blank">Talking Points Memo</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>The White House is preparing to dismantle Obama’s climate change policy</strong>. Trump will order Scott Pruitt, EPA chief, to withdraw and rewrite a set of Obama-era regulations known as the Clean Power Plan, which was devised to shut down hundreds of heavily polluting coal-fired power plants and freeze construction of new coal plants, while replacing them with vast wind and solar farms. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/climate/trump-climate-change.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Trump's budget slashes funds for the EPA and State Department</strong>. The budget would funnel an additional $54 billion into defense programs, beef up immigration enforcement, and significantly reduce the nondefense federal work force to further the “deconstruction of the administrative state,” in the words of Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Major elements of the plan have already been declared dead on arrival by the Republican leadership in Congress, and much of the fiscal fine print will be filled in by Capitol Hill lawmakers and their aides over the next month. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/us/politics/budget-epa-state-department-cuts.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Trump will reexamine fuel efficiency standards set in place during the Obama administration</strong>, opening the door for the regulations to potentially be reduced in the coming years. Trump will not take steps to revoke a waiver that allows California and a dozen other states to enforce emissions standards beyond those of the EPA. If those regulations remain intact, automakers will still be compelled to produce more fuel efficient cars regardless of any changes at the federal level. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/03/15/trump-to-pull-back-epas-fuel-efficiency-determination-opening-the-door-for-reduced-standards/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>EPA chief Scott Pruitt says carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to global warming</strong>. Pruitt's view is at odds with the opinion of NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/09/epa-chief-scott-pruitt.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Planned EPA cuts will hit black and Hispanic communities the hardest</strong>, which already suffer disproportionately from toxic pollution. (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/03/epa-environment-budget-cuts-pollution-justice-office" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Some of the EPA's longstanding and best-known programs are facing potential elimination</strong>. Details of an Office of Management and Budget proposal would cut the EPA's budget by 24% and reduce its staffing by 20%. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/02/politics/epa-programs-donald-trump-budget/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Trump begins E.P.A. rollback with executive order on clean water rules</strong>. The order, which will have almost no immediate legal effect and could take longer than a single presidential term to dismantle, directs E.P.A. chief Scott Pruitt to rewrite the 2015 rule known as the Waters of the United States. The rule gives the federal government broad authority to limit pollution in major bodies of water as well as in streams and wetlands that drain into them.</p>				  

<p>Trump is also expected to sign a similar order instructing Pruitt to begin the process of withdrawing and revising Obama’s 2015 climate-change regulation, aimed at curbing emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants. In his former job as attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt led or took part in 14 lawsuits intended to block the E.P.A.’s major regulations, including the clean water and climate rules that he is now charged with dismantling. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/politics/trump-epa-clean-water-climate-change.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Recently confirmed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt used a private email for state business</strong>. The revelation is in direct conflict with the former Oklahoma Attorney General's written and oral testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Pruitt told lawmakers he had never used private email for state business in his confirmation process. (<a href="http://okcfox.com/news/fox-25-investigates/ags-office-confirms-pruitt-used-private-email-for-state-business" target="_blank">Fox 25 - KOKH</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Thousands of emails show that the E.P.A. chief worked to battle environmental regulation</strong> as attorney general of Oklahoma. Scott Pruitt, now head of the Environmental Protection Agency, closely coordinated with major oil and gas producers, electric utilities, and political groups to roll back environmental regulations. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/us/politics/scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Senate on track to confirm Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator</strong> despite calls from Democrats to delay until he turns over thousands of requested emails from his time as attorney general as part of a public records lawsuit. Democrats boycotted a committee vote on Pruitt's nomination last month in an effort to delay his confirmation. Republican leaders have shown no signs they intend to wait for the documents to be released before voting to confirm him.

<p><strong>Senate confirms climate-change skeptic Scott Pruitt to lead EPA, an agency he sued as Oklahoma attorney general</strong>. Pruitt’s confirmation marked a serious defeat for environmental advocacy groups. Pruitt has sued the EPA more than a dozen times during the Obama administration, challenging the agency’s authority to regulate toxic mercury pollution, smog, carbon emissions from power plants and the quality of wetlands and other waters. In Oklahoma, he dismantled a specialized environmental protection unit that had existed under his Democratic predecessor and established a “federalism unit” to combat what he called “unwarranted regulation and systematic overreach” by Washington. Pruitt cleared the Senate by a vote of 52-46.

<p><strong>The EPA posted a mirror of its site before Trump can cut the real one</strong>. The mirror is an archive of the site the way it appeared the day before Trump took office.

<p><strong>EPA workers try to block Trump’s contentious nominee to run the agency in show of defiance</strong>. Employees of the EPA have been calling their senators, urging them to vote against the confirmation of Scott Pruitt. Many of the scientists, environmental lawyers and policy experts who work in EPA offices say the calls are a last resort. Pruitt has made a career out of fighting the agency. Trump has vowed to “get rid of” it. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Trump aims to sign executive orders cutting into the EPA's climate work shortly after his nominee to lead the agency is confirmed by the Senate</strong>. Trump has vowed to roll back Obama-era EPA actions, including major climate change regulations like the Clean Power Plan and a water jurisdiction rule opposed by many conservatives.

<p><strong>GOP bill would gut EPA</strong>. A House Republican is sponsoring legislation to do away with large portions of the Environmental Protection Agency, including environmental justice and greenhouse gas programs. The Wasteful EPA Programs Elimination Act would save $7.5 billion annually and would leave the EPA with a budget of less than $1 billion. Major EPA climate change programs would be eliminated under the measure. (<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/318931-gop-bill-would-gut-epa" target="_blank">The Hill</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Hundreds of current, former EPA employees urge Senate to reject Trump’s nominee for the agency</strong>. The controversial nomination advanced out of a Senate committee last week after Republicans used their majority to suspend committee rules and approve Pruitt despite the absence of all Democrats, who boycotted the nomination vote partly because of his anti-regulatory bent. He could be approved by the full Senate as early as this week. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/06/hundreds-of-current-former-epa-employees-urge-senate-to-reject-trumps-nominee-for-the-agency/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>				  

<p><strong>Scott Pruitt, Trump’s EPA pick, is approved by Senate committee</strong>. Senate Republicans pressed forward with the confirmation of Trump’s controversial nominee, suspending the Environment and Public Works Committee’s rules to approve the cabinet pick despite a Democratic boycott. The 11-0 vote sends the nomination to the full Senate, where Mr. Pruitt is most likely to be approved next week.
