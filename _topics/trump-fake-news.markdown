<p><strong>Trump called a congresswoman "wacky" and said she told a "total lie" about his call to the widow of a solider killed in Niger</strong>. "The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson(D), who was SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!" Trump tweeted. Frederica Wilson said Trump told the widow her husband <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/18/day-272/#1-trump-denied-telling-the-widow-of">"knew what he signed up for"</a> in a condolence call.

<p><strong>Putin's "chef" is believed to have financed the Russian "troll factory" that used social media to spread fake news</strong> during the 2016 US presidential campaign. Yevgeny Prigozhin is a Russian oligarch and the main backer of the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency. A declassified assessment by US intelligence concluded in January that the "likely financier of the so-called Internet Research Agency of professional trolls located in Saint Petersburg is a close Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence." It did not name Prigozhin directly. Prigozhin was at one point, allegedly, Putin's "personal chef," in addition to having catering contracts with Russia's armed forces. He also once served caviar and truffles to George W. Bush during a summit in St. Petersburg.

<p><strong>In response to the NBC News story, Trump tweeted that NBC’s broadcast license should be pulled as punishment</strong> for reporting what he considers fake news. “Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a ‘tenfold’ increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!” Trump tweeted. “With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License?

Tillerson <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/04/day-258/#1-rex-tillerson-reportedly-called-tr">reportedly</a> called Trump a "fucking moron" and nearly resigned this summer.

Trump tweeted. The tweet comes in response to yesterday's news that the committee is still <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/04/day-258/#3-the-senate-intelligence-committee">investigating possible collusion</a> between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential race.

<p><strong>Today, Tillerson denied he considered resigning from his job, but did not address whether he called Trump a "moron."</strong> Minutes before Tillerson's remarks, Trump tweeted that NBC News was "fake news" and "more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!" Immediately after Tillerson spoke, Trump tweeted, again, that the NBC News "story has just been totally refuted" by Tillerson and that the news network "should issue an apology to AMERICA!" Later in the day Trump called it “a totally phony story” and said he has "total confidence” in Tillerson.

<p><strong>The House intelligence committee is focusing on Russian ads bought on Google</strong>, search engine manipulation, fake news, and the potential uses of YouTube. Google had initially said it found no evidence of targeted tactics like the thousands of election-related ads purchased on Facebook.

<p><strong>Twitter briefed members of the Senate and House intelligence committees about fake news spread by Russian accounts</strong> and what steps the company took to stop it. Twitter told Congress that about 200 accounts are tied to some of the same Russian-linked sources that purchased ads on Facebook. The vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee criticized Twitter for failing to aggressively investigate the Russian misuse of its platform beyond the accounts linked to fraudulent profiles already identified by Facebook. Mark Warner said the company's presentation “showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions and again begs many more questions than they offered." He added: “Their response was frankly inadequate on every level.” (<a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/9/28/16378104/twitter-senate-house-russia-investigation-facebook-presidential-election-fake-news">Recode</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/us/politics/twitter-russia-interference-2016-election-investigation.html">New York Times</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Russian-bought political Facebook ads criticized Hillary Clinton, promoted Trump, and supported Bernie Sanders</strong> even after his presidential campaign had ended. The ads appeared designed to create divisions while sometimes praising Trump, Sanders, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.  A number of the ads questioned Clinton’s authenticity and touted liberal criticisms of her candidacy. Trump took to Twitter to suggest that Facebook had colluded with the news media against him during the campaign, tweeting: "Facebook was always anti-Trump. The Networks were always anti-Trump hence, Fake News @nytimes (apologized) &amp; @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?" He added: "But the people were Pro-Trump! Virtually no President has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months – and economy roaring."

<p><strong>Trump took to Twitter on his first day of vacation to lash out at the “Fake News” media and insist that his political base is only “getting stronger"</strong> despite a drop-off in his approval rating and the intensifying Russian investigation. “The Trump base is far bigger and stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling). Look at rallies in Penn, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia,” Trump tweeted. “The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs, Supreme Court pick, economic enthusiasm, deregulation and so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together. Will never change!” He added: “Hard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES and WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger!”</p>

Pence has created his own political fund-raising committee, signaling to major Republican donors that he's the heir apparent if Trump does not seek a second term. “Whatever fake news may come our way, my entire team will continue to focus all our efforts to advance the president’s agenda and see him re-elected in 2020," Pence said in a statement. "Any suggestion otherwise is both laughable and absurd.” (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/06/pence-new-york-times-2020-trump-241365">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/06/us/politics/mike-pence-election-2020.html">New York Times</a>)</p>

He insisted that Democrats "can't beat us at the voting booths, so they're trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want.

Rod Wheeler’s lawsuit claims that Fox fabricated quotes implicating DNC staffer Seth Rich in the WikiLeaks scandal. “We’re going to litigate this case as we would any other,” and that means “we’ll want to depose anyone who has information,” including the president, Wheeler's attorney.

<p><strong>Fox News and a Trump donor created a fake news story to deflect attention from the administration's ties to Russia</strong>, a lawsuit alleges. The story is about the death of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, which first aired in May, but was retracted a week later. The lawsuit, filed by Rod Wheeler, a paid commentator for the news network, claims a Fox News reporter created quotations out of thin air and attributed them to him in order to propel the story. A month before the story ran, Trump donor Ed Butowsky and Wheeler met at the White House with Sean Spicer to brief him on what they were uncovering. At a press gaggle after the story ran, Spicer claimed to have no knowledge of the Rich story. Spicer now confirms meeting with the two.

Clinton responded on Twitter: "Good morning Mr. President. It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me." Ivanka sat in for Trump when he stepped away for a one-on-one discussion with other leaders. Ivanka serves as an unpaid adviser to Trump as the assistant to the president with an office in the West Wing, blurring the lines between family and official business.

It’s not just your tweeting, it’s your scapegoating. It’s your refusal to see that sometimes you’re the one who’s feeding your own beast and acting beastly with your own guys.

<p><strong>One of the greatest threats Trump poses is that he corrupts and corrodes the absoluteness of truth, facts and science.</strong> It is no coincidence that the rise of Trump is concurrent with the rise of “fake news.” It is no coincidence that his rise comes during an age of severely damaged faith in institutions. Our president is a pathological liar. Say it. Write it. Never become inured to it. And dispense with the terms of art to describe it. A lie by any other name portends the same.

<p><strong>Fake news is about to get even scarier than you ever dreamed.</strong> What we saw in the 2016 election is nothing compared to what we need to prepare for in 2020. If there’s one thing we learned from this election cycle, it is that there are a number of reasons that people create fake-news stories. And, it has become clear that most new consumers don’t want to know if what they are reading is real or fake; they just want to know that it helps support their worldview.

<p><strong>Trump's impulses now carry the force of the presidency.</strong> Impetuous and instinctive, convinced of broad, but hidden plots to undermine him, eager to fight and prone to what an aide called “alternative facts,” Trump has shown in just days in office that he is like few if any occupants of the White House before him.

<p><strong>For Trump, everything is a rating.</strong> Trump spent his first weekend in office at war with math. He said that his inauguration crowd — which photographs showed was dwarfed by Barack Obama’s estimated 1.8 million in 2009 — “looked like a million, a million and a half.” His staff members backed up that claim with what his adviser Kellyanne Conway memorably termed “alternative facts.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/arts/television/for-trump-everything-is-a-rating.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

If the president and his aides will tell easily disproven falsehoods about crowd sizes and speeches, what else will they be willing to dissemble about?
